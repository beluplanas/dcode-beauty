So now you know that vitamin C is awesome Its proven to have antioxidant collagenboosting and skinbrightening magic abilities but the problem is that its really really unstable To solve the stability issue the cosmetic industry is coming up with derivatives and Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate AAP is a newish version created by a Korean company
According to the manufacturer AAP is a water soluble stable derivative that has both antiwrinkle and whitening effects They conducted an invivo made on real people study with 33 participants and found that the test formula with just 05 AAP significantly reduced hyperpigmentation age spots after 8 weeks by 2933 They also measured a dramatic decrease in the total number of wrinkles about 23 after 8 weeks If thats dramatic we are not sure Also be patient because after 4 weeks the wrinkle reduction was only a couple of percent
As for published studies on AAP we found hardly anything We found one done by Estee Lauder that briefly mentions AAP as an antioxidant that adds additional UV protection to sunscreen formulas Another one done by Oriflame reviewed skinwhitening ingredients and also briefly mentioned AAP as a skinlightening active
Overall there is not much data on Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate but it does seem like a promising derivative with antioxidant antiwrinkle and skinbrightening properties If you are into vitamin C derivatives and are happy to experiment its worth a go"

As far as clinical data goes the manufacturer did a 21 days study with 40 volunteers and found that 3 Lanablue showed a clear reduction of the skin microrelief or to say it in another way it made the skin smoother Based on the data we have seen we think that retinoidlike effects claim for this algae is an exaggeration If you are into retinol alternatives Bakuchiol is a more promising molecule to check out"
16,Arachidyl Alcohol,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/arachidyl-alcohol,A fatty alcohol the nondrying type with a long oil loving chain of 20 carbon atoms that is used to increase the viscosity of the formula and it also helps the oily and the watery parts to stay nicely mixed together called emulsion stabilizing

All in all arbutin is one of the betterknown skin brightening agents thats probably worth a try if pigmentation is an issue for you"

21,Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil,"When it comes to cosmetic oils and hype argan oil is for sure leading the way Dubbed as the liquid gold of Morocco we have to admit we have some trouble determining why this oil enjoys such a special miracle status Not that its not good it is good even great but reading the research about argan and a bunch of other plant oils we just do not see the big unique differentiating factor though that might be our fault not reading enough obvs
So argan oil comes from the kernel of the argan fruit that comes from the argan tree that grows only in Morocco The tree is slow growing and getting the oil is a hard job The traditional process is that the ripe argan fruits fall from the tree then goats eat them up and poop out the seeds The seeds are collected and smashed with a stone to get the kernels inside This part is the hard one as the seeds have extremely hard shells Once the kernels are obtained the oil is pressed out from them the kernels contain about 50 oil
As for skincare argan oil is loaded with lots of skin goodies but so are many other plant oils it contains 80 nourishing and moisturizing unsaturated fatty acids mainly oleic 3850 linoleic 2838 and palmitic 1018 It also contains a relatively large amount of antioxidant vitamin E 600900 mgkg about twice as much as olive small amounts of antioxidant phenols including caffeic acid ferulic acid and epicatechin as well as some rare sterols with soothing and antiinflammatory properties Thanks to all the above goodness in argan oil it can greatly nourish and moisturize the skin and hair Its also claimed to be able to neutralize collagendamaging free radicals help reduce scars and revitalize and improve skin elasticity You can even read that argan might help acneprone skin but being a high oleic oil we would be careful with that All in all argan oil is a real goodie but we do not fully understand the special miracle status it enjoys"
22,Arginine,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/arginine,A semiessential infants cannot synthesize it but adults can amino acid that is one of the primary building blocks of hair keratin and skin collagen Its a natural moisturizing factor a skin hydrator and might also help to speed up wound healing Arginine usually has a positive charge cationic that makes it substantive to skin and hair those are more negatively charged surfaces and an excellent film former Thanks to the positive charge it also creates a complex with AHAs AHAs like to lose a hydrogen ion and be negatively charged so the positive and the negative ions attract each other that causes a timerelease AHA effect and reduces the irritation associated with AHAs
23,Aristotelia Chilensis Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/aristotelia-chilensis-oil,Maqui Berries are small dark berries similar to betterknown blackberries that grow natively in the temperate rainforests of Chile The fruit is touted as a superfruit rich in antioxidant anthocyanins and other phenolics The oil is a dark green liquid that similar to other plant oils is loaded with unsaturated fatty acids 86 such as nourishing oleic acid 33 and barrierrepairing linoleic acid 46 We could not find any other researchverified info about Maqui Oil though some websites claim that it is rich in Vitamin E and is generally a strong antioxidant oil

25,Arnica Montana Flower Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/arnica-montana-flower-extract,A nice yellow flower living in the mountains It has been used as a herbal medicine for centuries though its effect on skin is rather questionable Its most famously used to treat bruisings but there are some studies that show that its not better than placebo source wikipedia Also some consider it to be antiinflammatory while other research shows that it can cause skin irritation
26,Aronia Melanocarpa Fruit Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/aronia-melanocarpa-fruit-extract,The extract coming from the dark colored berry called black chokeberry It looks similar to the blueberry but is even darker and the berries do not taste nice and yummy but are rather sour Its mainly used for juice jam and wine production but not as a fruity snack As for skincare and the black chokeberry we have good news the berries are loaded with stuff goodfortheskin including high amounts of antioxidant polyphenols mainly anthocyanins some astringent tannins hydrating sugar compounds as well as some minerals relatively high contents of potassium and zinc and some quantities of Na Ca Mg and Fe and nice vitamins vitamins B1 B2 B6 and C Overall Aronia Melanocarpa is a potent antioxidant berry thats nice to spot on the ingredient list
27,Ascorbic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/ascorbic-acid,"Works best between a concentration of 520 Boosts the skin’s own collagen production Fades pigmentation and brown spots If used under sunscreen it boosts its UV protection Extremely unstable and oxidizes very easily in presence of light or air Stable in solutions with water only if pH is less than 35 or in waterless formulations Vit E C work in synergy and provide superb photoprotection Ferulic acid doubles the photoprotection effect of Vit CE and helps to stabilize Vit C Potent Vit C serums might cause a slight tingling on sensitive skin If Vit C was a person it would be someone like Beyoncé Jennifer Lopez or Mariah Carey Serious performance Alist superstar but at the same time shows some major divaish behaviour But before we dive into it let’s just take a quick look where Vit C comes from By the 18th century sailors noticed that if they eat plenty of citrus fruits that helps to prevent scurvy an ugly disease that causes bleeding gums and other bad things caused by Vit C deficiency At that time they had no clue what it was inside citrus fruits that helped Scientists managed to figure out only in the 1930s what Vitamin C is Since then it’s been a much researched lovely vitamin that has turned out to have tremendous health benefits not only for our body but also for our skin It’s the primary watersoluble antioxidant in our tissue and plays a big role in the complicated process where our skin creates some nice new skinfirming collagen So it’s really good to have plenty of Vit C in our body and in our skin but the trick is that our body cannot make it for itself fun fact some animals like mice can We have to take it entirely from outside sources Citrus fruits black currants red pepper or guava are for example awesome Vit C rich foods that you should eat regularly And here is an another trick eating Vit C does not help our skin to have high levels of it And of course when the sun shines upon us or when we face environmental pollution that is also not good for the Vit C levels in our skin But here is good news putting some lovely Vit C cream or serum on our skin actually helps So how does it help exactly Let’s see
Great antioxidant and UV protection booster
Multiple studies showed that animal skin treated with topical ascorbic acid have less skin reddening it’s called erythema fewer sunburn cells and decreased tumor formation after UV exposure
What this means is that it’ a great idea to use your Vit C serum in the morning under your sunscreen not instead of it For even better protection choose a serum that contains Vit E as well as it doubles the photoprotection properties of Vit C And wait it gets even better Ferulic acid further doubles the photoprotection of Vit C E So this trio Vit C E Ferulic acid is really effective If you are into protecting your skin from UV rays and you should be if you want lovely skin for a long time you should try a serum containing the magic trio BTW this was discovered by American researcher Sheldon Pinnell in 2005 and Skinceuticals CE Ferulic Serum was the first one on the market containing all three actives
Helps skin to make nice collagen
Collagen is complicated but the most important thing to know about it is that it’s like tent pole It helps to keep our skin firm and wrinkle free Throwing poles on a ramshackle tent does not help The poles do not go magically to the right place to make the tent nice and firm again It’s the same with collagen in a skincare product it does not really help to be fair it has some hydrating properties but not wrinkle erasing magic properties Boosting the collagen production of your skin helps And Vit C can do that In a study from 1999 a 10 Vit C serum CellexC was shown to decrease wrinkles when applied for a 3 month period A few years later another study using a 5 Vit C cream for a 6 month period showed statistically significant improvement in skin hydration wrinkles glare brown spots and skin density
Helping your skin to make extra collagen is always nice and Vit C is one of the very very few ingredients that is proved to do so in peer reviewed studies Alist superstar right
Fades brown spots
Brown spots or hyperpigmentation is just not nice and frankly it is very difficult to fade them just with skincare But Vit C can help For brown spots to form the body needs an enzyme stuffs that help chemical reactions in our body called tyrosinase Vit C works by inhibiting this enzyme so brown spots cannot form that effectively That is all nice and lovely and an Alist superstar performance But we have started our description saying that Vit C is such a diva So what about that Well here are its major diva demands
Extremely unstable oxidizes very easily
If you ever tried a pure Vit C serum and you have not used it up in a month or two then you must have noticed that it changed its color and started to become brownish Yes that was the Vit C going wrong in the product There are some tips and tricks that help to stabilize Vit C Low pH below 35pH or waterless formulation helps Also some other ingredients help like ferulic acid glutathione citric acid or sodium metabisulfite These are all shown in research studies to help with the stability issues Also protecting the formula from air and light is super important The best is a totally airless packaging when it comes to Vit C formulas But even with all these tricks employed a potent Vit C serum can be used usually only three month after opening it Diva see
Does not penetrate skin easily
It is water soluble and skin is just not attracted to water soluble things but rather to oil soluble things So this makes it a little tricky for Vit C to actually get into your skin But good news low pH again below 35pH solves the problem so look out for water based Vit C serums that state that they have the right pH or waterless formulas can work too High amount of Vit C can irritate sensitive skin
Slight tingling is quite normal but if your skin is super sensitive rosacea prone than a very potent above 10 Vit C serum might not be for you You know if there are some big advantages there will always be some disadvantages too That’s just how it is Still Vit C is so awesome that you should try it at least once and see how your skin reacts It’s always individual so you never know for sure until you try it If you are still here congrats You are now a true “Vitamin C and the skin” expert"
28,Ascorbyl Glucoside,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/ascorbyl-glucoside,"A form of skincare superstar vitamin C If you do not know why vitamin C is such a big deal in skincare we have a really detailed geeky description thats good to read So now you know that because pure vitamin C is such a diva very unstable and hard to formulate the cosmetic industry is trying to come up with some derivatives that have the badass antiaging properties of vitamin C antioxidant protection collagen boosting fading hyperpigmentation but without the disadvantages This is a hard task and there is not yet a derivative that is really proven to be better in every aspect but Ascorbyl Glucoside is one of the best options when it comes to vitamin C derivatives Lets see why
First its really stable and easy to formulate so the problems that come with pure vitamin C are solved here
Second in vitro meaning made in the lab not on real humans studies show that ascorbyl glucoside can penetrate the skin This is kind of important for an antiaging ingredient to do the job so this is good news though invivo made on real humans studies are still needed Third invitro studies show that after ascorbyl glucoside is absorbed into the skin it is converted to pure vitamin C though the rate of conversion is still a question mark It also shows all the three antiaging benefits antioxidant protection collagen boosting fading hyperpigmentation that pure vitamin C does Bottom line ascorbyl glucoside is one of the best and most promising vitamin C derivatives that shows similar benefits to that of pure vitamin C but its less proven in vivo vs in vitro studies and the extent of the benefits are also not the same"
29,Ascorbyl Palmitate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/ascorbyl-palmitate,"A form of skincare superstar vitamin C Even though we are massive vitamin C fans Ascorbyl Palmitate AP is our least favorite Btw if you do not know what the big deal with vitamin C is then you are missing out You must go and read our geeky details about it So AP is one of the attempts by the cosmetics industry to solve the stability issues with vitamin C while preserving its benefits but it seems to fall short on several things
Whats the problem
Firstly its stability is only similar to that of pure ascorbic acid AA which means it is not really stable A great study in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology compared a bunch of vitamin C derivatives and this derivative was the only one where the study said in terms of stability that its similar to AA Not really that good
Second a study that examined the skin absorption of vitamin C found that ascorbyl palmitate did not increase the skin levels of AA This does not mean that ascorbyl palmitate cannot penetrate the skin because it can its oil soluble and the skin likes to absorb oil soluble things but this means that its questionable if ascorbyl palmitate can be converted into pure Vit C in the skin Even if it can be converted the palmitate part of the molecule is more than the half of it so the efficacy will not be good and we have never seen a serum that contains a decent and proudly disclosed amount of AP We are highly skeptical what effect a tiny amount of AP has in a formula
Third another study that wanted to examine the antioxidant properties of AP was surprised to find that even though AP does have nice antioxidant properties following UVB radiation the same one that comes from the sun it also promotes lipid peroxidation and cytotoxicity It was only an invitro study meaning that it was done on cell cultures and not on real people but still this also does not support the use of AP too much The only good thing we can write about Ascorbyl Palmitate is that there is an invitro made in the lab not on real people study showing that it might be able to boost collagen production
Regarding the skinbrightening properties of pure vitamin C this is another magic property AP does not have or at least there is no data not even invitro about it
Overall Ascorbyl Palmitate is our least favorite vitamin C derivative It is there in lots of products in tiny amounts honestly we do not really understand why however we do not know about any vitamin C serum featuring AP in high amounts That is probably no coincidence If you are into vitamin C you can take a look at more promising derivatives here"
30,Asiatic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/asiatic-acid,One of the biologically active components of Gotu Kola Its a bit less prominent than its sister component Asiaticoside but invitro made in the lab studies show that Asiatic Acid also stimulates GAGs glycosaminoglycans polysaccharides that are part of the liquidy stuff between our skin cells production as well as collagen I synthesisEnglish translation equals that it probably contributes to the wellestablished moisturizing and wound healing abilities of Gotu Kola
31,Asiaticoside,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/asiaticoside,One of the main biologically active components of the famous medicinal plant Centella Asiatica aka Gotu Kola It has well established wound healing and antioxidant activities Invitro made in the lab studies also show that Asiaticoside stimulates GAGs glycosaminoglycans polysaccharides that are part of the liquidy stuff between our skin cells production as well as collagen I synthesis Read more at Gotu Kola
32,Aspartic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/aspartic-acid,A nonessential amino acid important building block of collagen and elastin that hydrates the skin It is also used to set the pH of the cosmetic product buffering
33,Astaxanthin,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/astaxanthin,An oilloving redorange colored pigment that is becoming more and more wellknown as a potent antioxidantIf being an orangecolored pigment reminds you of betacarotene from carrots that is no coincidence astaxanthin also belongs to the chemical group called carotenoids known for giving yellow orange or red color to plants Our guy comes mostly from microalgae a wellknown and often used source is Haematococcus Pluvialis So Astaxanthins main thing is being an antioxidant You can take it as a supplement or slather it on your skin it works both ways A mouse skin study from 2012 found that a liposomal Astaxanthin formula prevented UV‐induced skin damage in multiple ways UVinduced skin thickening collagen reduction and melanin formation were all hindered or prevented when the skin was pretreated with the Astaxanthin formula Another study from 2012 examined the cosmetic benefits of Astaxanthin and found that combining oral supplementation 6mgday and topical application for 8 weeks in 30 volunteers showed improvements in skin wrinkle crow’s feet age spot size cheek elasticity crow’s feet skin texture cheek and moisture content of the skin cheek If that would not be enough a 2017 mouse study found our carotenoid molecule to be effective in speeding up wound healingOverall Astaxanthin is an up and coming antioxidant nice to spot on any ingredient list
34,Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/astragalus-membranaceus-root-extract,Astragalus Membranaceus or Huangqi as the Chinese call it is one of their most important medicinal herbs that is traditionally used to strengthen qi the body’s life force It has a bunch of magic abilities including tonic liverprotecting immunomodulating antihyperglycemic antiinflammatory antioxidant and antiviral properties Modern research does prove that Huangqi is a valuable medicinal herb and contains plenty of bioactive compounds such as saponins flavonoids and polysaccharides As for skincare and Huangqi it is well known and used for its general tonic and skin reinforcing properties as well as for its antiinflammatory and antioxidant action On top of that we also found a manufacturer claiming that Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract combines antiaging and antiblemish properties so it is especially useful for aging acneprone skin In their invivo made on real people studies 2 of liposomal Huangqi increased skin hydration firmness and smoothness by 20 after 14 days and decreased blemishprone skin signs by 1015 after 42 days
35,Avena Sativa Kernel Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/avena-sativa-kernel-extract,When you hear oatmeal you probably think of breakfast but the finely ground version of whole oat kernels aka colloidal oatmeal can do good things for your skin especially if its dry itchy or prone to skinrashes or eczemaOat is loaded with compounds good for the body inside or outside such as soothing agent betaglucan 5 lipids 311 including barrier repairing omega3 and 6 fatty acids or phenolic antioxidant and antiinflammatory agents avenanthramides The soothing antioxidant and skinprotecting abilities of oat are so wellestablished that it is an active natural ingredient covered by the FDA OTC Skin Protectant monograph in the US meaning that colloidal oatmeal can be claimed as an active ingredient on the INCI list and Aveeno is a massmarket brand built around oatcontaining products If your skin is dry irritated inflamed or eczemaprone colloidal oatmeal is something to try
36,Avena Sativa Kernel Flour,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/avena-sativa-kernel-flour,A finely powdered form of Oat Extract that has the same skin soothing skin protecting and antioxidant benefits we have written about at Avena Sativa Kernel Extract It is loaded with skingoodies such as antiinflammatory agent betaglucan skin nourishing lipids and moisturizing carbohydrates A real goodie for dry irritated inflamed or eczemaprone skin
37,Azelaic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/azelaic-acid,Superstar ingredient with antibacterial skin cell regulating antiinflammatory and skinlightening magic properties It is especially useful for acneprone or rosaceaprone skin types in concentration 10 and up It is a prescription drug in the US but can be freely purchased in the EU in an up to 10 concentration Azelaic acid is a superstar acid with some serious magic properties Before we list them out heres just a short introAzelaic acid is a socalled carboxylic acid It’s not an AHA or BHA but a distant relative to them all being carboxylic acids It can be found naturally in wheat rye and barley Magic property no1 Antibacterial effect → AntiAcneA very cool property of azelaic acid is that it has a great antibacterial effect It works against multiple bacteria including the evil acnecausing Propionibacterium acnes P acnes Very few ingredient are proven to work against P acnes so this alone makes azelaic acid an awesome choice for acneprone skin For acne treatment 20 is the standard prescription strength choice Comparing 20 azelaic acid to other acne treatments like 005 retinoic acid cream 5 benzoyl peroxide cream or 2 erythromycin ointment azelaic acid had nothing to be ashamed for as it showed similar effectiveness There is also a study that showed that 5 azelaic acid is also somewhat effective about 32 improvement and it can be made much more effective by combining it with 2 clindamycin about 64 improvementMagic property no 2 Regulate the production of skin cells → AntiAcneOne of our favourite beauty blogs xoVain cites dermatologist Dr David Lortscher who gives a great explanation “Azelaic acid also works on the cells that line hair follicles by changing the way they mature and proliferate which decreases follicular ‘plugging’ and helps prevent blackheads whiteheads and inflamed acne lesions” So basically it helps with healthy skin cell production in the pores that is often problematic in acne and blackhead prone skin which is niceMagic property no 3 Antiinflammatory effect → Antirosacea antiacneThe third magic property of azelaic acid is that it is proven to have an e antiinflammatory effect This is cool not only for treating acne but also for treating rosacea 15 is the standard prescription strength dose for rosacea treatment Magic property no 4 Skin lightening effect → AntiPIH antimelasmaLast but not least azelaic acid also shows skin lightening properties It seems to be especially effective for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation that often comes with acne and melasma Studies have compared 20 azelaic acid to 2 and 4 Hydroquinone and here again it has nothing to be ashamed of azelaic acid showed similar skin lightening properties Though interestingly azelaic acid did not seem to be effective for lightening age spots that are called solar lentiginesSo the bottom line is that azelaic acid can be a game changer or rather skin changer especially for acneprone or rosacea skin types It’s antibacterial can regulate problematic skin cell production in pores it’s antiinflammatory and even helps with PIH and melasma It really can do a lot
38,BHA,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/bha,Its the acronym for Butylated Hydroxy Anisole Its a synthetic antioxidant thats used as a preservative Its a somewhat controversial ingredient The US National Institutes of Health says that BHA is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals source wikipedia But and this is a big but these experiments were made on animals and BHA was used in high doses as part of their diet There is no evidence that the same is true when used in tiny amounts in cosmetics products So you probably have nothing to worry about but if you are a better safe than sorry type there are plenty of nice products without BHA to choose from
39,BHT,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/bht,Its the acronym for Butylated Hydroxy Toluene Its a common synthetic antioxidant thats used as a preservativeThere is some controversy around BHT Its not a new ingredient it has been used both as a food and cosmetics additive since the 1970s Plenty of studies tried to examine if its a carcinogen or not This Truth in Aging article details the situation and also writes that all these studies examine BHT when taken orallyAs for cosmetics the CIR Cosmetic Ingredient Review concluded that the amount of BHT used in cosmetic products is low usually around 00101 it does not penetrate skin far enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream and it is safe to use in cosmetics
40,Bakuchiol,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/bakuchiol,"At first glance you could think that Bakuchiol is your average plant extract It is derived from the seeds of Psoralea Corylifolia aka Babchi a plant important in Indian and Chinese medicine The molecule was first isolated in 1973 and several antisomething properties are known about it it has antiinflammatory antioxidant antitumor antibacterial and hepatoprotective magical abilities like plenty of other Ayurvedic plant extracts
What makes Bakuchiol a special snowflake is the recent discovery that it behaves on the skin in a way very similar to wellknown skincare superstar retinol While chemically it has nothing to do with the vitaminA family aka retinoids comparative gene expression profiling a fancy way of saying that they compared how retinol and bakuchiol modify the way skin cells behave and produce important skin proteins such as collagen shows that retinol and bakuchiol regulate skin cell behavior in a similar way To be more specific both Bakuchiol and retinol upregulate collagen I III and IV production and downregulate MMP the evil collagen attacking enzyme in our skin This means more collagen stays in our skin and we all know that more collagen equals firmer more wrinklefree skin A 12week clinical study using a 05 Bakuchiol formula with 17 people using it twice a day confirmed a significant improvement in lines and wrinkles elasticity firmness and an overall reduction in photodamage Also the test formula was very well tolerated without any retinollike side effects Whats more a 2018 doubleblind study with 44 people compared 05 Bakuchiol with 05 retinol cream and found that bakuchiol is comparable to retinol in its ability to improve photoaging and is better tolerated than retinol A super promising result after 12 weeks If you are not a daredeviltype who doesnt want to stop using a super wellproven retinol for a newbie like Bakuchiol we have good news The two also work very nicely together and Bakuchiol can actually help to stabilize the otherwise unstable and hard to formulate retinol
And we are still not done as Bakuchiol shows not only antiaging properties but also nice antiacne effects 1 Bakuchiol seems to be very effective in itself 57 reduction in acne after 6 weeks treatment and even better when combined with 2 salicylic acid 67 reduction in acne after 6 weeks We like that Bakuchiol is such a good team player The molecule works against acne in multiple ways It downregulates 5αreductase a sebumcontrolling enzyme it is antibacterial including P acnes antiinflammatory and it inhibits lipidperoxidation an evil oxidative process that is recently thought to be a very early trigger in the acne process We feel that this description is becoming very long so we will just mention that Bakuchiol also seems to positively regulate hydrationrelated genes such as Aquaporin 3 and also shows some melanininhibiting properties Overall we think Bakuchiol is an awesome molecule with lots of promise both for antiaging and antiacne But the proof compared to the wellestablished superstars is far from solid so in a skincare routine we would rather add Bakuchiol next to retinol than straight up replace it Unless you are a gimmethenewestshinythingunderthesuntype"
41,Barosma Betulina Leaf Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/barosma-betulina-leaf-extract,The extract coming from Buchu a SouthAfrican medicinal plant traditionally used to treat urinary tract infectionsAs for skincare the main active component of Buchu leaves is a flavonoid called diosmin that can act as an APN aminopeptidase N inhibitor APN is an enzyme that plays some role in the sebocyte the skin cells that create sebum differentiation and sebum generation process and inhibiting it means less sebum produced by the skin The manufacturer did some invivo tests with 20 volunteers for 28 days and found that Barosma Betulina Leaf Extract does have a statistically significant sebum regulating effect though do not expect miracles the average reduction of sebum was only 13 that we think is not that much
42,Behentrimonium Methosulfate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/behentrimonium-methosulfate,In itself its an antistatic stops your hair from flying around because of electricity hair conditioning and softening ingredient used mainly in haircare products Coupled with Cetearyl Alcohol they form an easy to handle super stable emulsifier duo that has exceptional spreadability and gives a pleasant final touch to the products
43,Behenyl Alcohol,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/behenyl-alcohol,A fatty alcohol the nondrying type with a long oil loving chain of 22 carbon atoms that is used to increase the viscosity of the formula and it also helps the oily and the watery parts to stay nicely mixed together called emulsion stabilizing
44,Bentonite,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/bentonite,"When it comes to oilabsorbing clay masks bentonite will probably be one of the first ingredients on the INCI list Technically bentonite clay is mostly montmorillonite something else and thanks to the something else bit bentonite comes in different types and colors The color depends on the mineral content of the clay white bentonite is rich in boron and fluoride yellow is rich in manganese and zinc green is rich in copper zinc and manganese and the pink clay is rich in boron
No matter the color bentonite is excellent at absorbing things it can suck up the sebum and gunk from the skin and make it instantly smooth and matte Not only that but bentonite has a negative ionic charge and thus can attract things with a positive charge Things with a positive charge include bad bacteria and toxins and bentonite clay masks can help to clear those out of the skin and pores btw bentonite is edible and has the same detoxifying effect internally Thanks to bentonites effect against bad bacteria and pathogens there is also some research showing that bentonite can help to calm skin infections soothe skin allergies and might work for skin conditions like psoriasis and eczema
On the other hand the downside of bentonite being such a good absorbent is that it can suck up more than the excess sebum and used too often it can easily dry out the skin So use it for good measure and never forget to moisturize afterwards"
45,Benzoic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/benzoic-acid,An Ecocertapproved natural preservative that counts as gentle and nonirritating to the skin Usually it comes to the formula as part of a preservative blend as its not enough on its own
46,Benzophenone-3,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/benzophenone-3,"A chemical sunscreen agent that absorbs UVB and short UVA rays 280350nm with its peak protection at 288 nm Unlike many other chemical sunscreens it is highly stable but its UV absorbing abilities are weak so it always has to be combined with other sunscreen agents for proper protection More often than not its used as a photostabilizer rather than a proper sunscreen agent as it can protect formulas nicely from UV damage
Regarding safety BP3 is somewhat controversial First its molecules are small 228 Da and very lipophilic oil loving and these properties result in very good absorption The problem is that you want sunscreens on the top of your skin and not in your bloodstream so for BP3 this is a problem In fact it absorbs so well that 4 hours after application of a sunscreen product with BP3 it can be detected in urine Another concern of BP3 is that it shows some estrogenic activity though its probably not relevant when applied topically to the skin Estrogenic activity was confirmed only invitro in test tubes and when taken orally by lab animals and not when used topically as you would normally In fact a 2004 followup study to examine the estrogenic effect of sunscreens when used topically on the whole body found that the endogenous levels of reproductive hormones were unaffected even though BP3 could be detected both in plasma and urine so its absorption is no doubt too good
If that was not enough Wikipedia claims that BP3 is nowadays the most common allergen found in sunscreens and the alwaystrustworthy smartskincare writes that benzophenones have been shown in some studies to promote the generation of potentially harmful free radicals
On the up side sunscreens are pretty well regulated in several parts of the world and BP3 is considered safe as used and is an allowed sunscreen agent everywhere It can be used in concentrations of up to 10 in the EU and up to 6 in the US
Overall BP3 is probably our least favorite sunscreen agent and we prefer sunscreens without it However if you find a formula that you love and contains BP3 we do not think that you should throw it away A sunscreen with BP3 is definitely better than no sunscreen"
47,Benzophenone-4,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/benzophenone-4,A watersoluble chemical sunscreen agent that is a secondary UVB absorber with some activity in the short UVA range as well Being a secondary UV absorber means that its protection is weak and it has to be combined with other sunscreen filters for proper sun protection More often than not Benzophenone4 is not used as a sunscreen agent but as a photoprotectant to extend product shelf life or as a colorprotectant for products in clear packages A Contact Dermatitis article from 2007 names BP4 as an emerging allergen as it was the most frequently positive chemical UV filter and third most frequently positive ingredient overall among the 35 substances patch tested in the study 13 positives of 1693 people tested
48,Benzophenone-5,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/benzophenone-5,Benzophenone5 is the sodium salt brother of Benzophenone4 and just like that guy this one also works mainly as a photoprotectant to extend product shelf life or as a colorprotectant for products in clear packages
49,Benzoyl Peroxide,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/benzoyl-peroxide,The gold standard topical ingredient in treating acne There is no miracle cure for acne we do really wish for one sigh but Benzoyl Peroxide BP is probably the closest thing we have But as usual big effects come with big side effects so we think BP is best used as a last resort at least in the topical treatment field The good thing about BP is that it is amazingly effective against inflammatorytype acne Not so much against blackheads or whiteheads but against acne that is caused by the evil bacteria called Propionibacterium acnes and that is most types of acne Apart from being antibacterial it is also antiinflammatory keratolytic and woundhealing all of which are properties that make it so darn effective against spotsAnother big pro of BP is that there is no bacterial resistance to it meaning if it works once it will continue to work Antibiotics are also a common way to treat acne but antibioticresistant P acnes are increasing worldwide BP will probably help you even if antibiotics have stopped working and the two are also often combined for a more complex acne therapy Btw BP plays nice not only with antibiotics but also with retinoids The sideeffects part BP works its antibacterial magic by being a powerful oxidizing agent meaning it is a prooxidant As in the opposite of an antioxidant BP literally generates evil ROS reactive oxygen species in the skin that kills P acnes but also harms the surrounding skin cells Ongoing BPuse ages your skin which is why we say use it as a last resort If you do use BP please also use a good sunscreen and a good antioxidant serum to apologise to your skin btw these things are useful in any case Use the BP treatment at night and the antioxidant serum in the morning so that they do not cancel each other outAnother side effect of BP is that it can be very skin drying BP is an example where more is not better In fact it is equally effective at concentrations of 25 50 and 10 but the higher the concentration the more irritating and drying side effects occur So using BP at 25 percent is the ideal amount Another side effect which is good to know is that BP can bleach bedsheets and clothes Be careful with your expensive satin bedsheetsOverall Benzoyl Peroxide is a uniquely effective topical acne treatment but it comes at a price Use it as a last resort and for good measure and with plenty of moisturizers sunscreen and antioxidant serum
50,Benzyl Alcohol,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/benzyl-alcohol,"Its one of those things that help your cosmetics not to go wrong too soon aka a preservative It can be naturally found in fruits and teas but can also be made synthetically
No matter the origin in small amounts up to 1 it’s a nice gentle preservative Has to be combined with some other nice preservatives like potassium sorbate to be broad spectrum enough In high amounts it can be a skin irritant but don’t worry it’s never used in high amounts"
51,Benzyl Benzoate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/benzyl-benzoate,A common fragrance ingredient that has a faint sweet balsamic smell It can also be a solvent and can fight against microbes and insects very wellIts one of the “EU 26 fragrances” that has to be labelled separately because of allergen potential Best to avoid if your skin is sensitive

55,Beta Vulgaris Root Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/beta-vulgaris-root-extract,Beetroot is a beautifully colored vegetable that you probably know from the kitchen As for skincare according to manufacturer info it works as a natural moisturizer that might be able to increase the concentration of NMFs natural moisturizing factors in the upper layer of the skin giving skin both immediate and longer term hydration According to Paulas Choice its also a colorant and a source of antioxidants
56,Beta-Glucan,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/beta-glucan,"BetaGlucan is a nice big molecule composed of many smaller sugar molecules called polysaccharide It’s in the cell walls of yeast some mushrooms seaweeds and cereals
It’s a real goodie no matter if you eat it or put it on your face Eating it is antidiabetic anticancer and even lowers blood cholesterol Putting it on your face also does a bunch of good things it‘s shown to have intensive skin repairing wound healing properties it’s a mild antioxidant a great skin soother and moisturizer and it even shows promising antiaging benefits The manufacturer of the ingredient did a published study with 27 people and examined the effect of 01 betaglucan They found that despite the large molecular size the smaller factions of betaglucan penetrate into the skin even into the dermis the middle layer of the skin where wrinkles form After 8 weeks there was a significant reduction of wrinkle depth and height and skin roughness has also improved greatly Bottom line Betaglucan is a great ingredient especially for sensitive or damaged skin It soothes moisturizes and has some antiaging magic properties"
57,Betaine,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/betaine,A sugar beet derived amino acid derivative with nice skin protection and moisturization properties Betains special thing is being an osmolyte a molecule that helps to control cellwater balance It is also a natural osmoprotectant meaning that it attracts water away from the protein surface and thus protects them from denaturation and increases their thermodynamic stability It also gives sensorial benefits to the formula and when used in cleansers it helps to make them milder and gentler
58,Betaine Salicylate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/betaine-salicylate,The combination of famous exfoliant salicylic acid and gentle moisturizer betaine It counts as a mild exfoliant and natural moisturizer skin smoothing agent You usually find this guy in KBeauty products as due to regulations pure salicylic acid can be used only in tiny amounts in SouthKorean formulations A generally accepted ballpark number is that betaine salicylate is twice as gentle as salicylic acid ie a 4 betaine salicylate product is similar to a 2 salicylic acid one
59,Betula Alba Bark Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/betula-alba-bark-extract,Its the extract from the silverwhite bark of the Birch tree that grows on moors in North and Middle Europe and in North America It contains tannins and triterpenes that give the extract antioxidant antiirritant and astringent magic properties There is also research showing that birch bark extract can improve the skin barrier increase skin hydration and reduce transepidermal water loss Can be a useful ingredient both for dry and oily skin
60,Bifida Ferment Lysate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/bifida-ferment-lysate,"Bifida Ferment Lysate is a probiotic ingredient that’s used in one of the most iconic serums in the world the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Based on manufacturer info it potently protects against UVinduced damage in the skin and helps with DNA repair An Estee Lauder patent from 2009 also talks about DNA repair activity
As far as published research goes we could find one promising one It showed that applying 10 bacterial extract to sensitive reactive skin helped with better barrier function and decreased skin sensitivity Overall it is definitely a promising ingredient even for sensitive skin types but not the most proven one yet"
61,Biosaccharide Gum-1,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/biosaccharide-gum-1,"Biosaccharide Gum1 is a pretty interesting kind of sugar ingredient that is created from sorbitol via bacterial fermentation According to the manufacturer it’s a “SMART” sugar it has Soothing Moisturizing Antiaging Restructuring and Touch properties Let’s look at them quickly one by one
Soothing the manufacturer tested out the soothing effect in vivo meaning on humans that is always a good thing by measuring how 3 Biosaccharide Gum1 decreased the tingling sensation caused by 10 lactic acid The result was good the tingling was decreased by 47
Moisturizing Compared to famous hyaluronic acid it turns out that the two are great together HA has a quicker effect and provides more instant hydration much more hydration was measured after 1h of application while our nice sugar has a somewhat delayed effect demonstrating stronger hydration after 3h of application After 8 hours both had similar moisturizing effect Antiaging According to exvivo tests meaning not on humans so do not trust it too much Biosaccharide Gum1 can stimulate a protein in our skin called sirtuin1 This is supposed to help our skin cells to live longer and function better Resurfacing The sirtuin1 stimulation also results in quicker cell renewal something that happens anyway but slows down as we age And the quicker cell renewal is good because it helps the regeneration of the barrier function That is especially nice for fragile sensitive skin
Touch our fermented sugar is not only good to the skin but it also feels great on the skin It gives a nice “soft touch” feeling and makes the products pleasant to use The bottom line is that the above info is from the manufacturer and we could not find any relevant independent research so obviously take it with a grain of salt But Biosaccharide Gum1 does look as an interesting and promising ingredient that’s why it earned our goodie rating"
62,Biosaccharide Gum-2,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/biosaccharide-gum-2,An interesting polysaccharide a big sugar molecule obtained by bacterial fermentation Its sugar sequence is rich in rhamnose galactose and glucuronic acid According to its manufacturer Biosaccharide Gum2 is a protecting agent against the damages from external aggressors that accelerate skin aging and its a booster of skin comfort stimulating the release of pleasure molecules
63,Biotin,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/biotin,Also called vitamin H biotin is the main component of many enzymes in our body A nice ingredient to take as a supplement for stronger nails and hair When you do not take it as a supplement its effects are a bit more questionable but according to manufacturer info it can smooth the skin and strengthen the hair
64,Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/biotinoyl-tripeptide-1,A three amino acid peptide where the famous collagen fragment Tripeptide1 aka GHK is combined with Biotin the wellknown supplement for stronger nails and hairs The result of the combination is Biotinoyl Tripeptide1 a peptide claimed to be helpful for reducing hair loss and for making the eyelashes appear longer fuller and strongerAs for proof the manufacturer did some invitro made in test tubes studies that show that our molecule can promote hair bulb keratinocyte proliferation and also helps optimal hair anchorage by stimulating the synthesis and organization of the adhesion molecules laminin 5 and collagen IV This means that our peptide might help the hair to be stronger and to stay longer in its place though these are only in vitro results that might or might not translate to realworld use As for a clinical made on real people study the manufacturer did one for eyelash growth with 30 volunteers Using a mascara with 2 of SpecPed LashLD trade name for the diluted buyable version of Biotinoyl Tripeptide1 the lashes got longer by 17 and thicker by 19 after 30 days

Its claimed to efficiently and continuously work over 24 hours by a continuous threephase mechanism it dims oxidative stress builds up protection from ROS evil free radicals and prevents the formation of further reactive species
If that would not be enough it also seems to be a promising ingredient for acne prevention In an invivo test on 22 volunteers a 2 BisEthylhexyl Hydroxydimethoxy Benzylmalonate formula decreased skin oiliness by 20 after 8 weeks of treatment and skin inflammation and redness also improved by 25"
68,Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol-methoxyphenyl-triazine,"Its INCI name is a bit of a mouthful but BisEthylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine is worth recognizing it as it is one of the best sunscreen agents known today Unfortunately its not FDAapproved so you will not find it in sunscreens coming from the US not because its not good but because US regulations make it impossible for newer sunscreen agents to get approved but it is widely available in other parts of the world like Europe Australia or Asia It is a broadspectrum covers the whole UVB and UVA range 280400 nm chemical sunscreen agent with peak protections at about 310 and 345 nm and unlike older UV filters its very photostable It hardly deteriorates in the presence of UV light and its also useful in stabilizing other less stable sunscreen agents like the famous UVA protector avobenzone
Its a new generation sunscreen agent that was specifically designed for high SPF and good UVA protection and based on a 2007 study that compared 18 sunscreen agents available in the EU it really had the best SPF protection they used the highest concentration allowed by EU regulations from each 18 sunscreens and Trinosorb S gave an SPF 20 all by itself It is an oilsoluble slightly yellowish powder that is not absorbed into the skin too much This is good news for a sunscreen agent as it needs to be on the surface of the skin to do its job properly Regarding BisEthylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine side effects we have good news here as well it has a great safety profile and unlike a couple of other chemical sunscreens Trinosorb S and M does not show estrogenic activity Overall we think Trinosorb S is one of the best sunscreen options available today
Are you into sunscreen agents We have shiny explanations along with product lists about others as well Methylene BisBenzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol aka Tinosorb M the good buddy of our current molecule Tinosorb S
TrisBiphenyl Triazine aka Tinosorb A2B the newest addition to the Tinosorb family that protects strongly in an inbetween wavelength that most other filters miss Ethylhexyl Triazone aka Uvinul T 150 another new generation sunscreen agent with superhigh UVB protection

72,Borago Officinalis Leaf Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/borago-officinalis-leaf-extract,"When it comes to borage and skincare the seed oil is the one thats usually mentioned thanks to its uniquely high gammalinolenic acid content
But the leaves are not useless either they contain great antioxidant compounds like polyphenols and flavonoids and show significant freeradical scavenging activity though much less than vitamin C and similar to the synthetic antioxidant BHT"
73,Borago Officinalis Seed Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/borago-officinalis-seed-oil,We feel that this one is a bit under the radar probably because the Borage plant is not very well known Maybe because its name isnt as cool as some others its hard to compete with kukui or baobab not to mention murumuru But let us tell you when it comes to skin care borage seed oil is one of the best oils that can happen to your skin Especially if its dry sensitive easily irritated often itchy or eczema prone So what is so special about it It is the richest known plant source of the super important essential fatty acid gammalinolenic acid GLA GLA is soothing and nourishing and can repair even severely dry and irritated skin but its pretty rare and borage contains by far the most of it 1728 Next to GLA it also contains more common fatty acids like linoleic 36 oleic 18 or palmitic acid 10 If your skin is dry and sensitive this one is totally for you

75,Boswellia Serrata Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/boswellia-serrata-extract,"The extract coming from the Indian Frankincense a mediumsized tree native to India Mostly the gumresin is used that is obtained from an incision made on the trunk of the tree It contains about 3060 resin 510 fragrant essential oil and the rest is made up of polysaccharides mostly arabinose galactose xylose
The biologically most active components of the resin are boswellic acids that have antiinflammatory properties According to manufacturer info the boswellic acids rich resin extract is also a potent inhibitor of elastase an enzyme that breaks down proteins including collagen and has antiGAGase activity protecting the important natural moisturizing factors glycosaminoglycans in the skin meaning that it can help the skin to stay firm for a longer time
The reason why we did not award Boswellia Serrata Extract a goodie status is that this INCI name is not clear enough on the type of the extract It might be a boswellic acids rich antiinflammatory extract that is a goodie or it might be a fragrant essential oil rich extract used in perfumery or aromatherapy that can be a problem for sensitive skin types"
76,Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/buddleja-davidii-meristem-cell-culture,The extract of summer lilac or butterflybush in itself is a nice ingredient with some antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties and the manufacturer claims that the meristem cell culture is even betterIt contains among others verbascoside and isoverbascoside that have not only antioxidant and antiinflammatory but also photoprotective activity What’s more it has phytosterols amino acids and polysaccharides all useful for skin moisture

78,Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane,"The famous Avobenzone It is a special snowflake as it is the only globally available chemical sunscreen agent that provides proper UVA protection in the US new generation sunscreen agents are not approved because of impossible FDA regulations It is the global gold standard of UVA protection and is the most used UVA sunscreen in the world It gives very good protection across the whole UVA range 310400 nm that is both UVA1 and UVA2 with a peak protection at 360 nm The problem with it though is that it is not photostable and degrades in the sunlight Wikipedia says that avobenzone loses 36 of its UVabsorption capacity after just one hour of sunlight yep this is one of the reasons why sunscreens have to be reapplied after a few hours
The cosmetics industry is trying to solve the problem by combining avobenzone with other UV filters that enhance its stability like octocrylene Tinosorb S or Ensulizole or by encapsulating it and while both solutions help neither is perfect Interestingly the combination of avobenzone with mineral sunscreens that is titanium dioxide and zinc oxide is not a good idea In the US it is flat out prohibited as avobenzone becomes unstable when combined with mineral sunscreens
As for safety avobenzone has a pretty good safety profile It counts as nonirritating and unlike some other chemical sunscreens it shows no estrogenic effect The maximum concentration of avobenzone permitted is 5 in the EU and 3 in the US"
79,Butylene Glycol,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/butylene-glycol,"Butylene glycol or let’s just call it BG is a multitasking colorless syrupy liquid It’s a great pick for creating a nice feeling product BG’s main job is usually to be a solvent for the other ingredients Other tasks include helping the product to absorb faster and deeper into the skin penetration enhancer making the product spread nicely over the skin slip agent and attracting water humectant into the skin
It’s an ingredient whose safety hasn’t been questioned so far by anyone at least not that we know about BG is approved by Ecocert and is also used enthusiastically in natural products BTW it’s also a food additive"

103,Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/camellia-sinensis-leaf-extract,"Green tea is one of the most researched natural ingredients The active parts are called polyphenols or more precisely catechins EGCG being the most abundant and most active catechin There can be huge quality differences between green tea extracts The good ones contain 5090 catechins and often make the product brown and give it a distinctive smell Green tea is proven to be a great antioxidant UV protectant antiinflammatory anticarcinogenic and antimicrobial Because of these awesome properties green tea is a great choice for antiaging and also for skin diseases including rosacea acne and atopic dermatitis We will tell you straight away that we are big green tea fans Drinking it and slathering it all over your face are both great ideas But as this is INCIDecoder and not a findoutwhat’shealthytodrink site we will now just focus on why you should put it on your face
Our first reason is that green tea does not only sound good but it’s super well researched According to one of our fav dermatologist dr Leslie Baumann it’s one of the most studied antioxidants A 2015 research summary paper on green tea stated that there are about 6000 research papers on the topic currently in PubMed the US National Library of Medicine research database Before we dive into what the magic powers of green tea are it’s good to know that the most useful components of the tea are called polyphenols and even more precisely catechins There are four major types the most abundant and active one the real superstar is called EGCG EpiGalloCatechin Gallate Also significant ones are ECG EpiCatechin Gallate GCG GalloCatechin Gallate and EGC EpiGallo Catechin but there are also a few more types in green tea To be able to truly judge the efficacy of a green tea product dr Baumann emphasises that it’s important to know the polyphenol content of the extract used There can be huge quality differences between various green tea extracts depending on climate season age of the leaf and how it was grown You know it’s like the tomato that you buy middle of the summer fresh from the market vs the tomato that you buy middle of the winter from a big supermarket and it was picked totally unripe on the other half of the word a while ago they taste totally different According to the 2015 research summary paper an average extract contains only 10 catechins while Dr Todorov of the fantastic smartskincarecom site writes about 25 vs only 4 in black tea Dr Leslie Baumann says in her Cosmetic Dermatology book that a good quality green tea extract should contain 5090 catechins and the highquality ones are brownish and have a characteristic odor So if you stumble upon a green a tea product that’s brown and has a distinct tealike smell that is a great sign of a quality product Ok so now you know that not all green tea extracts are made equal and which ones are the good ones Let’s see those magic powers
Great Antioxidant UV protectant The polyphenols in green tea are strong proven antioxidants That’s good because they help to protect our skin against notsonice little things called free radicals that are out there to destroy the very nice firming collagen in our skin Studies show that green tea reduces UV caused skin irritation and reddening it’s called erythema and decreases the number of sunburn cells It’s a great idea to use a green tea product in the morning under your sunscreen Anticarcinogenic This one partly comes from the antioxidant and UV protectant properties but we wanted to emphasise that green tea does not only give some “superficial” skin benefits but is truly a health protectant It can inhibit DNA damage and even activates some enzymes that help with DNA repair Thanks to this it’s very useful for preventing nonmelanoma type skin cancer So especially if your skin cancer risk factors are high fair skin skin cancer history in the family blue or green eyes past sunburns some types of moles introducing green tea into your skin care is a fantastic thing to do Antiinflammatory Inflammation is an important process that’s a biological protective response to not nice things that happen to our body However too much inflammation in our skin is not good it accelerates the aging process and it’s also behind many skin diseases acne and rosacea the most common examples The catechins in green tea are not only amazing antioxidants but they also possess magic antiinflammatory powers This makes green tea an awesome choice for sensitive rosacea or acne prone skin Antimicrobial This one is probably the least well known but green tea also shows promising antimicrobial properties against some notnice bacteria This property makes green tea even more awesome for acneprone skin We could find two promising research paper results showing that 2 green tea lotion is effective to treat mildtomoderate acne Also atopic dermatitis is a skin diseases that could be improved with the help of the green tea polyphenols So the bottom line is this green tea is a real superstar with magic powers that make it an awesome ingredient to almost everybody If you are worried about antiaging skin cancer prevention acne rosacea or atopic dermatitis it’s an excellent idea to use a highquality green tea product in your skincare routine"

One of the biological activities of the centellosides is to be able to stimulate GAGs glycosaminoglycans polysaccharides that are part of the liquidy stuff between our skin cells and especially hyaluronic acid synthesis in our skin This is probably one of the reasons why Centella Asiatica Extract has nice skin moisturizing properties that was confirmed by a 25 people four weeks study along with Centellas antiinflammatory effects
Madecassoside can also help in burn wound healing through increasing antioxidant activity and enhancing collagen synthesis Asiaticoside was shown to increase antioxidant levels on rats skin when applied at 02 Centella Asiatica also often shows up in products that try to treat cellulite or striae Of course it cannot make a miracle but it might have some effect via regulating microcirculation and normalizing the metabolism in the cells of connective tissues Bottom line Gotu Kola is a great plant ingredient with proven wound healing antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties Nice to spot on any ingredient list"

129,Ceramide EOP,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/ceramide-1,"Ceramides get quite a lot of hype recently and good news there is a reason for that But before we go into the details lets just quickly define what the heck ceramides are
They are waxy lipids that can be found naturally in the outer layer of the skin called stratum corneum SC And they are there in big amounts The goopy stuff between our skin cells is called extracellular matrix that consists mainly of lipids And ceramides are about 50 of those lipids the other important ones are cholesterol with 25 and fatty acids with 15 Ok so now we know what ceramides are lets see what they do in our skin research shows clearly that they play a super important role in keeping the skin barrier healthy and the skin hydrated If ceramides in the skin are decreased more water can evaporate from the skin and there is less water remaining in the skin So ceramides form kind of a waterproof protecting layer and make sure that our skin remains nice and hydrated Now the question is only this If we put ceramides all over our face do they work as well as ceramides already naturally in our skin Well the answer is probably a no but they do work to some extent The BeautyBrains blog made a fantastic article about ceramides and they have listed a couple of examples about studies showing that ceramides especially when used in certain ratios with cholesterol and fatty acids do hydrate the skin and can help to repair the skin barrier
So far we were writing about ceramides in plural Its because there are lots of different ceramides a 2014 article writes that currently 12 base classes of ceramides are known with over 340 specific species Chemically speaking ceramides are the connection of a fatty acid and a sphingoid base and both parts can have different variations that result in the different types of ceramides Our current one Ceramide 1 or more recently called Ceramide EOP was the first one that was identified in 1982 and its a special snowflake It contains the essential fatty acid linoleic acid and has a unique structure Its believed that ceramide 1 plays a binding role in the lipid layers of the extracellular matrix Along with ceramides 4 and 7 they also play a vital role in epidermal integrity and serve as the main storage areas for linoleic acid a fatty acid thats also very important for barrier repair Oh and one more thing alkaline pH inhibits enzymes that help ceramide synthesis in our skin So if you use a soap and you notice your skin is becoming dry now you know why"

183,Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Peel Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/citrus-aurantium-bergamia-peel-oil,The essential oil coming from the peel of the bergamot orange Its a common top note in perfumes and contains among others fragrant compounds limonene 37 linalyl acetate 30 and linalool 88 Fragrant compounds smell nice but are common allergens and can be a problem for sensitive skin types The bigger problem with bergamot oil though is that it also contains furanocoumarins more specifically bergapten and bergamottin that have welldocumented phototoxic effects A phototoxic reaction is a not nice one causing red edematous lesions on the affected area We think it is a good idea to avoid bergamot oil but if you have a product that you love make sure to use it at night onlyNowadays furanocoumarinfree versions of bergamot oil are also available and more and more common and they usually go by the INCI name Bergamot Fruit Oil
184,Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Fruit Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/citrus-aurantium-dulcis-fruit-extract,"We have to start by writing that there are about 900 citrus species in the world and plenty of them are used to make different kinds of extracts used in cosmetics This particular one Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Fruit Extract is a very common ingredient however the species Citrus Aurantium Dulcis seem to exist only on ingredient lists and the real world calls this guy Citrus Sinensis or you know orange To complicate matters further there are lots of varieties and lots of extraction methods so it is a bit hard to know what you are getting with this one but we will try our best to summarize the possibilities A very common scenario is that Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Fruit Extract is on the ingredient list for its mild natural exfoliant properties It contains mainly citric acid and some malic acid AHA exfoliants known for their skin renewing properties If thats the case it is usually combined with other AHA containing fruits such as bilberry sugar cane lemon and sugar maple in a super popular ingredient mix trade named ACB Fruit Mix
But orange fruit is loaded with lots of other active compounds with a wide variety of possible effects A wellknown one is the antioxidant vitamin C aka ascorbic acid but the dosage will vary based on the extraction method and it’s possible that some of the ascorbic acid content will degrade before extraction process even takes place If you want vitamin C in your skincare that is smart but do not rely on orange fruit extract for it
Flavonoids hesperidin naringin luteolin and ferulic acid are also nice active compounds with possible antioxidant antiinflammatory and vasoprotective effects Some of them namely hesperidin and luteolin might even have skin brightening activity by inhibiting tyrosinase the famous enzyme needed for melanin production
The orange extract also contains carbohydrates aka sugars mostly glucose fructose and sucrose but also some bigger polysaccharides such as pectin giving the ingredient some moisturizing properties
Some essential oil content is usually also present in citrus fruit extracts which means a nice scent and antibacterial properties but also some questionable compounds such as fragrance allergen limonene or phototoxic compound bergaptene If the amount is big enough to worry about is questionable probably not however the same question applies to all the nice beneficial compounds Overall we think that the orange fruit extract is a very complex ingredient with lots of potentially good things in it but we could not find proper invivo made on real people studies made with standardized extracts to validate what it really does or does not under realworld use cases"
185,Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/citrus-aurantium-dulcis-oil,"The essential oil coming from the sweet orange In the case of orange and citruses in general the essential oil is mainly in the peel of the fruit so its pretty much the same as the orange peel oil also has the same CAS number a unique ID assigned to chemicals

188,Citrus Limon Fruit Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/citrus-limon-fruit-extract,"If life gives the cosmetic industry lemon it makes lemon fruit extract As to why we can write here extremely similar things to our shiny description of orange fruit extract Being both of them citruses they contain very similar active compounds with very similar potential effects on the skin Just like orange fruit lemon fruit also contains citric acid so it is commonly used as a natural mild exfoliating agent If this is the case it is usually combined with other AHA containing fruit extracts such as bilberry sugar cane orange and sugar maple in a super popular ingredient mix trade named ACB Fruit Mix
But citrus fruits are chemically complex mixtures with a bunch of other active components such as vitamin C flavonoids phenolics carbohydrates and essential oil this latter one coming from the rind of the fruit but still present in some amount in the fruit extract These have the potential to give lemon extract antioxidant antibacterial antidandruff venotonic and moisturizing properties but the essential oil also brings some questionable compounds such as fragrance allergen limonene or phototoxic compound bergaptene If your skin is sensitive be careful with citrus extracts"
189,Citrus Limon Peel Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/citrus-limon-peel-oil,"The essential oil coming from the rind of the lemon that we make or should make lemonade from In general there are two problems with citrus peel oils first they are essentially the fragrant component limonene in disguise they are about 8598 limonene

192,Citrus Paradisi Peel Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/citrus-paradisi-peel-oil,The essential oil coming from the peel of the pink grapefruit In general the main component of citrus peel oils is limonene around 90 for grapefruit peel a super common fragrant ingredient that makes everything smell nice but counts as a frequent skin sensitizer Similar to other essential oils grapefruit peel has also antibacterial and antifungal acitivity Other than that citrus peels contain the problematic compounds called furanocoumarins that make them mildly phototoxic So be careful with grapefruit peel oil especially if its in a product for daytime use

198,Cocamidopropyl Betaine,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine,Super common ingredient in all kinds of cleansing products face and body washes shampoos and foam baths Number one reason for its popularity has to do with bubbles Everyone loves bubbles And cocamidopropyl betaine is great at stabilizing them The other reason is that it’s mild and works very well combined with other cleansing agents and surfactants The art of cleansing is usually to balance between properly cleansing but not overcleansing and cocamidopropyl betaine is helpful in pulling off this balance right Oh and one more nice thing even though it’s synthetic it’s highly biodegradable More info on CAPB on Collins Beaty Pages

221,Copper Tripeptide-1,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/copper-tripeptide-1,"GHKCu is a copperpeptide complex found naturally in yucky bodily fluids plasma saliva and urine It has unique wound healing properties by stimulating the breakdown of unhealthy too large collagen in scar tissue and stimulating nice and healthy collagen production afterwards It stimulates the production of several important skinidentical ingredients eg collagen elastin and glycosaminoglycans It has significant antiinflammatory and antioxidant effect There are a few promising studies showing GHKCu can improve skin elasticity clarity firmness and reduce lines and wrinkles It can improve hair growth by enlarging hair follicles and bigger follicles produce longer thicker hair There are some urban legends about possible overdosing or facial hair problems read more in geeky details Compared to Alist skincare superstars think vitamin C glycolic or retinol coppertripeptide seems to be the new and exciting thing but in fact it has been around for a long time since 1973 to be exact Before we dive in lets just quickly see what the heck coppertripeptide1 is or GHKCu The GHK part is a three amino acid peptide of glycinehistidinelysine that can be found naturally in yucky bodily fluids if you are wondering in plasma saliva and urine The Cu part is the copper an essential trace element in the human body and in all living things It turns out GHK and Cu love each other and if they meet they form a complex that is called coppertripeptide Wound healing and antiinflammatory properties The guy who discovered GHKCu is called Dr Pickart and in the first 15 years of his GHKCu studies he found out that it helps wound healing and has antiinflammatory properties His work resulted in the FDAapproved Iamin hydrating gel to treat acute and chronic wounds Helping wound healing does not seem like a big deal If you read around INCIDecoder you can read the same about plenty of other ingredients but GHKCu does have a special feature it can stimulate the breakdown of unhealthy too large collagen in scar tissue and can help stimulate nice and healthy normal collagen production And less bad collagen and more good collagen results in smoother nicer skin Helps good collagen production Helping collagen production is a big deal in antiaging skincare and there are very few ingredients that are really proven to do so Coppertripeptide is only halfway proven at this point but there are definitely promising results about it Dr Pickart himself made a successful invitro made in test tubes not on real people study in 1988 showing that CHKCu can stimulate collagen synthesis
There is an even more promising study from 1998 that was done on people and compared vitamin C tretinoin and coppertripeptide Do you know which one won Copper tripeptide After one month it increased collagen production in 70 of people while vitamin C only in 50 and tretinoin only in 40 More antiaging magic properties If the above isnt enough there is more GHKCu seems to have a complex role in skin health and tissue repair It does not only help collagen synthesis but also the synthesis of other important skinidentical ingredients like elastin proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans It also has an antioxidant effect by stimulating the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase and preventing the release of oxidationpromoting iron There are also a couple of facial studies showing that GHKCu containing creams can do pretty much everything you need for younger looking skin It can tighten loose skin and improve elasticity density and firmness It can reduce fine lines as well as deeper wrinkles It can improve skin clarity and even reduce hyperpigmentation Improving Hair Growth While studying the wound healing properties of GHKCu Dr Pickart also noticed that after treating skin wounds there was an enlargement of the hair follicles of the skin at the wound edge This led him to discover that skin remodelling copper peptides SRCPs can also stimulate hair growth It works by stimulating follicular cell proliferation that results in larger hair follicles that produce longer and thicker hair SRCPs also keep the hair follicles longer in the active anagen phase and shorter in the inactive dormant phase
So whats the catch Well most studies done on coppertripeptide are invitro meaning in the lab and not on real people or on animals Results may or may not be the same on us people There are some facial studies that are promising but they are quite small and not designed to the strictest standards by which we mean double blind placebo controlled
Another catch is that when it comes to facial antiaging skin care stimulating hair growth is not really a good thing unless of course more facial hair is ok for you Dr Pickart himself tells this about the issue The SRCPs increase the size of hair follicles but do not convert the small vellus hair follicles that produce fine nearly invisible hair 98 of body hair into terminal follicles 2 of body hair that produce thick long hair The enlarged hair follicles produce the stem cells needed to rebuild skin Many women have used our facial products for 5 years without problems Reading around on skincare forums some did see slightly more facial hair some not This is again something that you have to try and see
Last but not least there is an urban legend about the possibility to overdose on copper peptide resulting not in younger but older looking skin We could not find any study or research paper about this but Dr Todorov on smartskincare writes this excessive use can have an opposite effect by increasing the levels of free copper andor by triggering excessive production of metalloproteinases Free copper promotes free radical damage and collagen breakdown leading to accelerated skin aging Metalloproteinases can digest collagen and elastin weakening the skin and causing sag These problems do not seem to occur among the majority of copper peptide users However there are anecdotal reports indicating that such sideeffects might happen with overuse incorrect use or even normal use in sensitive individuals Ideally a sufficiently large study is needed to better quantify these risk
There you have it If you are still here congrats you just became a GHKCu expert It is definitely a very interesting and promising ingredient so if you are into antiaging and like to experiment this is something for you If you prefer the tried and true stick to your retinol treatment"

However Colins argues that in the case of formaldehydereleasing preservatives formaldehyde is released slowly and the skin has probably not evolved to deal with that The lingering formaldehyde might be toxic to the Langerhans Cells that are important for the skins defense system Another potential issue is that formaldehydereleasers might also release other things while reacting with amino acids in the skin that is probably the explanation why some people are not allergic to formaldehyde but are allergic to formaldehydereleasing preservatives These are all theories far from proven facts but we feel that there are some justified reasons why formaldehydereleasing preservatives and Dmdm Hydantoin count as controversial All in all its up to you to decide if you wanna avoid this preservative group or not If so there are other less risky and more skinfriendly options out there"

298,Ethyl Ascorbic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/ethyl-ascorbic-acid,"A very stable and promising form of the skincare superstar Vitamin C If you do not know why Vitamin C is such a big deal in skin care you can catch up here In short Vitamin C has three proven magic abilities antioxidant collagen booster and skin brightener The problem though is that its very unstable turns brown and becomes ineffective in no time after a few month and the cosmetics industry is trying to come up with smart derivatives that are stable and have the magic properties of pure Vitamin C Ethyl Ascorbic Acid or EAC for short is an etherified derivative of ascorbic acid that consists of vitamin C and an ethyl group bound to the third carbon position This makes Vitamin C very stable and soluble in both water and oil
However for a Vitamin C derivative to work its not enough just to be stable they also have to be absorbed into the skin and be converted there to pure Vitamin C We have good news regarding the absorption on top of manufacturer claims there is some data animal study demonstrating in can get into the skin and it seems to be better at it than Ascorbyl Glucoside another vitamin C derivative
Regarding conversion we can cite only a manufacturers claim saying that EAC is metabolized in the skin into pure ascorbic acid and the ascorbic acid content of EAC is very high 864 compared to the usual 5060 Vitamin C content of other derivatives As for the three magic abilities of Vitamin C we again mostly have only the manufacturers claims but at least those are very promising EAC seems to have both an antioxidant and antiinflammatory effect and its claimed to be able to boost the skins collagen production The strong point of EAC though is skin brightening On top of manufacturer claims there is also clinical invivo tested on real people data showing that 2 EAC can improve skin tone and whiten the skin Overall Ethyl Ascorbic Acid is a very promising but not a fully proven Vitamin C derivative Its worth a try especially if you are after Vitamin Cs skinbrightening effects"

So this unpronounceable guy is actually a nice molecule that mimics the behavior of the natural enzymes in our skin Estee Lauder likes this ingredient uses it and has done some studies to prove that Ethylbisiminomethylguaiacol Manganese Chloride aka EUK134 can nicely protect the cells from UVB damage They hypothesize that EUK134 via direct protection of the membrane from UVBinduced oxidative damage reduces oxidative stress induced MAPK signaling and consequently lowers the level of p53 induction The protection conferred by EUK134 results in a significant increase in cell survival following UVB irradiation
Another study also by Estee Lauder found that EUK134 lowers hydroperoxide levels at the surface of UVAexposed skin in vivo and concluded that this salen–manganese compound is a unique cosmetic tool to protect the skin surface from accumulating oxidative damage Other than that we found a study that examined a serum to manage skin redness in sensitive pale skin types and contained EUK134 along with a bunch of other ingredients The formula examined did reduce facial redness so EUK134 seems to be tolerated well even by rednessprone sensitive skin types"
305,Ethylene/​Propylene/​Styrene Copolymer,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/ethylene-propylene-styrene-copolymer,"A helper ingredient thats used as an oil gelling agent together with its sibling ButyleneEthyleneStyrene Copolymer

Regarding safety there are also some concerns around Octinoxate In vitro made in the lab not on real people and animal studies have shown that it may produce hormonal estrogenlike effects Do not panic the studies were not conducted under real life conditions on real human people so it is probably overcautious to avoid Octinoxate altogether However if you are pregnant or a small child under 2 yrs old choose a physical zinc oxidetitanium dioxide or newgeneration Tinosorb based sunscreen just to be on the supersafe side Overall Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate is an oldschool chemical sunscreen agent There are plenty of better options for sun protection today but it is considered safe as used and sunscreens are pretty well regulated and it is available worldwide can be used up to 10 in the EU and up to 75 in the US"

324,Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/galactomyces-ferment-filtrate,"A famous waterlike yeastderived ingredient that the whole SKII brand is built on As legend has it SKII scientists in the 1970s discovered by chance that aged Japanese sake brewers have amazingly soft and youthful hands in contrast to their aged and wrinkled faces They concluded that the secret must lie in the yeast that the brewers’ hands were in constant contact with during the sake fermentation process So Pitera obtained by a fermentation process of a certain yeast belonging to the genus Galactomyces was discovered as an antiaging skinnourishing magic liquid The company claims that the clear waterlike liquid is loaded with goodfortheskin stuff and is rich in vitamins amino acids minerals and organic acids As for the science behind Pitera SKII parent company PG did an invitro made in the lab study that confirmed that Piteracontaining moisturizers do indeed help to protect the skin against damage More specifically they found that Pitera has antioxidant effects and increases hyaluronan production in epidermal cells And more hyaluronic acid in the skin means better hydrated plumper healthier skin
If that would not be enough there is also a 2014 study showing that Pitera might be able to help with skin pigmentation and a 2015 study finding that Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate can activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor AhR thats important in epidermal homeostasis by upregulating epidermal barrier proteins English translation equals Pitera might be able to help with a healthy skin barrier All in all both anecdotal and scientific evidence show that Pitera is a skin goodie so if you are into essences and yeastderived fermentations its definitely worth a try"
325,Gallyl Glucoside,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/gallyl-glucoside,Gallyl Glucoside is a glycosylated form of gallic acid ie attaching the sugar molecule glucose to gallic acid coming from oak leaves It is known for its antioxidant and soothing properties and usually comes to the formula combined with other plantderived glucosides
326,Gelatin,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/gelatin,An animalderived gelling agent that is a close relative to Hydrolyzed Collagen It is created from the connective tissue bone and skin of animals usually cows or pigs and helps to thicken up waterbased formulas
327,Genistein,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/genistein,Genistein is a super active component of soybean It has very potent antioxidant abilities and is proven to inhibit UVBinduced redness in human skinIt is a phytoestrogen a plantderived molecule with estrogenic effect so it is especially useful for situations when natural estrogen levels are low such as during and after menopause Low estrogen levels can cause skin thinning and collagen loss and genistein might be able to help with that
328,Geraniol,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/geraniol,Geraniol is a common fragrance ingredient It smells like rose and can be found in rose oil or in small quantities in geranium lemon and many other essential oils Just like other similar fragrance ingredients like linalool and limonene geraniol also oxidises on air exposure and becomes allergenic Best to avoid if you have sensitive skin
329,Globularia Cordifolia Callus Culture Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/globularia-cordifolia-callus-culture-extract,Plant extract coming from the stem cell culture of heartleaved globe daisy It runs by the trade name Resistem and the manufacturer claims that it helps to reduce the level of proageing agents and local microinflammation in the skinTested on real people invivo Globularia Cordifolia Callus Culture Extract decreases skin redness by 134 compared to placebo and enhances natural skin glow 92 compared to placebo
330,Glucomannan,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glucomannan,"Glucomannan is a polysaccharide a big sugar molecule coming from the Konjac plant It has great waterabsorbing capacity and is one of the key ingredients in the plumping and smoothing active called Ultra Filling Spheres by BASF
The magic filling spheres have two active parts a kind of LMW hyaluronic acid 40 kDa and the konjac root powder or glucomannan The latter one is a big molecule 200 kDa that has outstanding waterabsorbing capacities These two combined form small spheres which after drying are transformed into the active spheres
Thanks to their high hygroscopic properties the spheres can expand rapidly in the presence of the skin’s water reserve and they can plump up the skin and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles"
331,Gluconolactone,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/gluconolactone,"It’s a polyhydroxy acid PHA that is often referred to as next generation AHA It gently lifts off dead skin cells form the skin surface making skin smooth and even In the long term it provides antiaging benefits like increased skin thickness and decreased wrinkles though a tad less than even more proven superstar AHAs It’s a great moisturizer and even helps to repair impaired skin barrier It’s antioxidant and does not make your skin more sensitive to the sun It can be used even if your skin is very sensitive rosacea prone or if you are post cosmetic procedure Gluconolactone is kind of an acid even though you would probably not guess it from its name It’s a PHA or polyhydroxy acid PHAs are close relatives to the famous AHAs both in terms of similar chemical structure and similar effects on the skin They are often marketed as newgeneration AHAs So if AHAs do not tell you anything you can read all about them here Go and read We tell you it’s worth the time
So the main promise of gluconolactone and also its brother the other most often used PHA lactobionic acid is that it has comparable awesome skin benefits to AHAs but without the irritation as a side effect Sounds great right
There was a study done in 2004 that compared a PHA skincare regimen and an AHA skincare regimen for 12 weeks focusing on irritation and antiaging benefits The result PHAs scored much better at irritation stinging and burning and much better means of course much less and they scored very similar for antiaging skinsmoothing effects There were only two aspects where the AHAs scored a bit better pinch recoil and skin sallowness Being gentle on the skin probably comes from the larger molecular size that means less penetration and less irritation In fact PHAs are so gentle that you can even use them if your skin is very sensitive even if you have rosacea or atopic dermatitis and they are also suggested post cosmetic procedure to prolong and enhance the skincare benefits Another area where PHAs excel is skin moisturization They are better at that than AHAs and can help to repair the skin barrier They are also shown to work successfully together and enhance the benefits of other actives including azelaic acid for rosacea or hydroquinone for hyperpigmentation And that’s still not all Gluconolactone also has antioxidant and chelating properties which means that it can prevent oxidation of easily oxidised other things Actually it’s antioxidant effect is comparable to famous Vit C though to be fair Vit C is awesome but not a particularly strong antioxidant in itself And one more super interesting study result as opposed to AHAs that increase sun sensitivity gluconolactone was shown not to do that Not that we want to tell you not to use sunscreen if you use a gluconolactone exfoliant please always use sunscreen but we thought this is interesting Bottom line Gluconolactone is a superstar and especially if your skin is sensitive it’s a must try It will smooth your skin even out the skin tone and even give antiaging benefits and all this without irritation Yep must try"
332,Glucose,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glucose,A fancy name for sugar Luckily when you put it on your skin its good for you not like when you eat it It has waterbinding properties which means that it helps to keep your skin nice and hydrated
333,Glutamic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glutamic-acid,"Glutamic acid is a little molecule and nonessential our body can synthesize it amino acid with the important job of being a neurotransmitter in the human body meaning that it helps your nervous system work correctly As for what its doing in cosmetics Glutamic acids main thing similar to other amino acids is being a humectant moisturizer and skinconditioning agent sidenote if you attach lots of glutamic acid molecules you get polyglutamic acid that is claimed to be a better than hyaluronic acid humectant It also seems to affect skin barrier repair however it is not clearcut in which direction
The complication is that glutamic acid has two distinct forms Lglutamic acid and Dglutamic acid that are the mirror images of each other think of it like your left and right hand Studies show that a topical application of Lglutamic acid on damaged skin delayed skin repair while Dglutamic acid application sped up skin repair As both forms are used by the industry it is a bit uncertain what you are getting with just glutamic acid on the ingredient list but if it is a Shiseido group product it is probably the goodie Dform Other than that Glutamic acid can also be used as a pH adjuster and can be processed via biological pathways into pyrrolidone carboxylic acid the sodium salt of which is a goodie and one of your skin’s natural moisturizing factors"
334,Glutamylamidoethyl Imidazole,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glutamylamidoethyl-imidazole,An antiaging chronopeptide that mimics sun exposure activation of the circadian genes they are essential in having a proper biorhythmThe manufacturer recommends the ingredient for tired stressed jetlagged skin or skin that lacks sun exposure Its claimed to stimulate the skins natural defense system and might help the skin to produce Vitamin D
335,Glycereth-26,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glycereth-26,Its a nice glycerinbased humectant and emollient that gives skin a smooth and luxurious feel
336,Glycereth-7 Trimethyl Ether,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glycereth-7-trimethyl-ether,A light yellow liquid ester that gives a slightly dry silky emollience on the skin Its unique property is that it is both watersoluble as well as castor oil soluble This dual solubility is a rare trait that enables the addition of water into waterless formulas such as lipsticks or balms Glycereth7 Trimethyl Ether is also very pH stable and dissolves salicylic acid so it can be a nice helper ingredient in alcoholfree alcohol is a very good solvent for SA salicylic acid formulas
337,Glycerin,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glycerin,"A natural moisturizer that’s also in our skin A super common safe effective and cheap molecule used for more than 50 years Not only a simple moisturizer but knows much more keeps the skin lipids between our skin cells in a healthy liquid crystal state protects against irritation helps to restore barrier Effective from as low as 3 with even more benefits at higher concentrations up to 2040 around 10 is a good usabilityeffectiveness sweet spot Highglycerin moisturizers are awesome for treating severely dry skin Glycerin doesn’t sound very glamorous but it is a real oldie but a goodie It’s been used in cosmetics for more than 50 years and it’s a totally natural ingredient that’s also in the outermost layer of our skin called stratum corneum SC It’s a socalled humectant type of moisturiser meaning that it helps our skin to cling onto water A 2005 study has shown that glycerin levels correlate with skin hydration levels so more glycerin means better hydrated skin
As newer studies examine glycerin it turns out more and more that it’s not just a simple humectant but also does some other important things It makes sure that the gooey stuff between the skin cells is neither too diluted nor too concentrated it’s called osmoregulation
It helps to maintain the healthy state of the cell membranes and intracellular lipids keeping the lipids in a nice liquid crystal state that is optimal for barrier function
It can normalize skin shedding in very dry skin It protects against skin irritation such as washing your face too much andor too aggressively What this all means is that glycerin is a real superstar and helps to maintain the healthy state of our skin in several ways And there is even more If your skin is severely dry you have to read this A largescale study done with 394 guys and girls with dry skin compared two highglycerin containing 25 and 40 glycerin moisturizers to 16 other popular moisturizers on the market that had less than 6 glycerin The two highglycerin ones won hands down They had superior quickacting hydrating properties and they also seemed to create a “reservoir” of moistureholding ability in the skin This means that even after not using the highglycerin moisturizer the skin stayed hydrated longer compared to all the other low glycerin moisturizers You might think now that this is sooo awsome I will go to the pharmacy right now buy some glycerin and put it on my face Well do not do that 100 pure glycerin is not good for the skin either Too much glycerin and in general humectants might attract water out of the lower layers of the skin That’s a problem because once water is in the upper layer some of it will evaporate It’s called transepidermalwaterloss TEWL If too much TEWL happens your skin becomes dry This is confirmed by a study too skin treated to 997 glycerin for 5 days showed that after the treatment the SC do you remember it’s the outermost layer of the skin was not visibly different from the untreated control The same study also examined skin treated with a 25 glycerin lotion and there the SC had a visibly different expanded in other words more hydrated appearance So the thing to know about the optimal amount of glycerin is this it is an effective molecule already from 3 even from 1 at least when combined with skin lipids and the benefits tend to increase up until 2040 Around 10 glycerin seems to have a reals sweet spot in terms of effects and usability This amount is still possible to formulate into a relatively light nonsticky and not too heavy formula yes glycerin is sticky and high is really hard to formulate into a cosmetically elegant formula but 10 also shows all the great therapeutic effects including effective moisturization with a reservoir effect protecting against irritation maintaining a healthy skin barrier and making the skin just smooth and plump So bottom line glycerin is a real goodie and far more than a simple moisturizer In our opinion it is an underappreciated superstar that deserves more spotlight than it is currently getting"
338,Glyceryl Acrylate/​Acrylic Acid Copolymer,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glyceryl-acrylate-acrylic-acid-copolymer,"Glyceryl acrylateacrylic acid copolymer is the fancy word for a common polymer big molecule from repeated subunits namely polyacrylic acid aka carbomer when it comes to cosmetics with glycerin attached to it in some places
The main thing of this polymer is that it forms a hydrogel trade named Lubrajel that can sit on top of the skin and provide moisturizing watersoluble ingredients such as glycerin to the skin Think of it as a very thin wet sponge that a cosmetic manufacturer can fill with good ingredients for your skin It also works as a thickening agent remember it is a carbomer type of molecule and can provide the skin with a nice slippery feel It can also draw water to the skin thank you pendant glycerol groups providing skin hydration
Also don’t let people scare you into thinking polyacrylic acid is dangerous because of the toxicity of acrylic acid Since acrylic acid is dangerous due to its ability to absorb into the skin since it’s small when you chain them together into a polymer which is big this danger is no longer significant"
339,Glyceryl Behenate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glyceryl-behenate,"The combination of glycerin behenic acid that comes either in a fine powder or waxy solid form Together with the di and triglyceride of behenic acid the trio has remarkable gelling properties helping cosmetic chemists to create ultrasoft and nontacky waterfree gels They also have great emulsion stabilizing properties and work as highperformance compacting agents for makeup products that come in the form of pressed powders
Its also vegetable origin and Ecocert certified"
340,Glyceryl Behenate/​Eicosadioate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glyceryl-behenate-eicosadioate,A waxy solid white stuff that is used as an oil gelling agent to create smooth nice gel textures The recommended use level is 25 according to the manufacturer
341,Glyceryl Caprylate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glyceryl-caprylate,A 100 plant derived natural Ecocert approved multifunctional ingredient that has emollient and moisturizing properties can work as a coemulsifier meaning that next to other emulsifiers it can help water and oil to mix and even more importantly has a strong antimicrobial activity Thanks to this last thing it allows a lower percentage of traditional preservative or it might even be able to completely replace them
342,Glyceryl Dibehenate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glyceryl-dibehenate,The combination of glycerin two behenic acid molecules that works as an oilgelling agent emulsion stabilizer and highperformance compacting agent in pressed powders We wrote a bit more at its little sis glyceryl behenate
343,Glyceryl Laurate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glyceryl-laurate,A glycerin and lauric acid derived multifunctional ingredient that works as a coemulsifier helps water and oil to mix together next to other emulsifiers emollient makes skin nice and smooth and antimicrobial agent preservative booster It also has some thickening and refatting properties in cleansing formulas
344,Glyceryl Oleate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glyceryl-oleate,The attachment of glycerin and oleic acid that works mainly as a coemulsifier and stabilizer to create stable wateroil mixes aka emulsions It is also popular in cleansing products as it helps to thicken them up and has some refatting and skinsmoothing effect
345,Glyceryl Stearate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glyceryl-stearate,"A super common waxy white solid stuff that helps water and oil to mix together gives body to creams and leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth
Chemically speaking it is the attachment of a glycerin molecule to the fatty acid called stearic acid It can be produced from most vegetable oils in oils three fatty acid molecules are attached to glycerin instead of just one like here in a pretty simple green process that is similar to soap making Its readily biodegradable
It also occurs naturally in our body and is used as a food additive As cosmetic chemist Colins writes it its safety really is beyond any doubt"
346,Glyceryl Stearate Citrate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glyceryl-stearate-citrate,Glyceryl stearate citrate is similar to the super common skincare ingredient glyceryl stearate and is similarly used to help combine waters and oils emulsifier and to make your skin feel nice and soft emollient The main difference between glyceryl stearate citrate and its cousin glyceryl stearate is that this one has a citric acid molecule also attached to its glycerin This makes it what chemists call a diacylglycerol which is a fancy word for two acids in this case citric acid and stearic acid attached together with a glycerin bridge But when it comes to cosmetics all you need to know is that both glyceryl stearate citrate and glyceryl stearate are safe tried and true emulsifiers Expect to see them in formulas with both waterbased and oilbased ingredients think moisturizers and lotions
347,Glyceryl Stearate SE,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glyceryl-stearate-se,"An oily kind of ingredient that can magically blend with water all by itself This is called selfemulsifying and SE in its name stands for that
The difference between normal Glyceryl Stearate and this guy is that the SE grade contains a small amount of waterloving soap molecules such as sodium stearate This increases Glyceryl Stearates affinity for water and gives it stronger emulsifying abilities Other than that it’s a nice emollient that gives a smooth and soft appearance to the skin
You can read some more at Glyceryl Stearate"
348,Glycine,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glycine,A nonessential amino acid the building blocks of skin proteins like collagen or elastin that the body can produce itself but its production decreases with age When you put it all over your face it works as a moisturizer and maybe more According to great skincare blog Futurederm glycine might help with wound healing and tissue repair and when used together with other amino acids leucine and proline it might improve wrinkles BTW its also a building block of a bunch of important and famous peptides including coppertripeptide1 palmitoyl tripeptide1 or palmitoyl hexapeptide12
349,Glycine Soja Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glycine-soja-oil,The emollient plant oil coming from the soybean It is considered to be a nice costeffective base oil with moisturizing properties As for its fatty acid profile it contains 4859 barrierrepairing linoleic acid 1730 nourishing oleic acid and also some 4511 potentially antiinflammatory linolenic acid
350,Glycine Soja Seed Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glycine-soja-seed-extract,When you hear the word Soy you probably associate it with soy sauce or tofu not skincare But as it turns out the soybean has a bunch of useful active components and soybean extract is an interesting cosmetic ingredient with a wide range of possible effects Its main active components are antioxidant phenolic acids and flavonoids as well as small and large soy proteins The large proteins give soybean extract nice skin smoothing and softening properties while the small proteins soybean trypsin inhibitor STI and BowmanBirk inhibitor BBI are thought to inhibit skin pigmentation and delay hair regrowth Regarding skin pigmentation the soybean extract works by hindering melanosome transfer meaning it blocks the melanin pigment from traveling up to the surface of the skin and becoming visible there This is useful for most pigmentation situations but if you have melasma soy is not for you as melasma is estrogenmediated and soy is a wellknown phytoestrogen The most famous and bioactive flavonoids in soybeans are the isoflavones called genistein and diadzein that have potent antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties Genistein is also proven to inhibit UV induced redness in human skin These isoflavones are also the ones that make soy a phytoestrogen meaning they have a weak estrogenic effect Topical estrogen is known to decrease skin thinning and collagen loss and soy might be able to do the same especially during and after menopause when natural estrogen levels run low There is also some promising but as yet not invivo done on real people research that soybean extract can stimulate both elastin and collagen synthesis and thus lead to healthier youngerlooking skin Overall soybean extract is a promising and multifunctional active a nice addition to most ingredient lists
351,Glycol Distearate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glycol-distearate,A socalled diester created from two stearic acid molecules and an ethylene glycol molecule Its main thing is being an opacifier and pearling agent in cleansing products making them white and glossy It can also give body to creams and emulsions
352,Glycolic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glycolic-acid,It’s the most researched AHA with the most proven skin benefits It gently lifts off dead skin cells to reveal newer fresher smoother skin It can help skin’s own collagen production that results in firmer younger skin It can fade brown spots caused by sun damage or PIH Choose a product where you know the concentration and pH value because these two greatly influence effectiveness Don’t forget to use your sunscreen in any case but especially so next to an AHA product Slight stinging or burning with a stronger AHA product is normal If your skin is very sensitive rosacea prone choose rather a BHA or PHA product Unless you have avoided every bit of skin care info out there so far in this case special welcome to you you must have heard of glycolic acid Or at least about AHAs or to put it even more nicesounding fruit acids AHAs alphahydroxy acids stand for a whole group of ingredients and glycolic acid is one of them If you are a chemist geek type you might want to know that the point of AHAs is that they contain a hydroxy group OH and a carboxylic acid part HO¬ 0 and these two parts are only one carbon apart if they are two carbons apart it’s a betahydroxy acid You can find great description and great drawings about all this on the super nice blog LabMuffin So glycolic acid is an AHA and it’s the smallest and simplest one of them It can be found naturally in grape sugar cane juice sugar beet and Virginia creeper leaves but more often than not the version used in cosmetics is synthetic We are pretty strict with awarding things superstar status so what’s the big deal with glycolic acid What does it do to our skinIt can exfoliateIt can gently lift off dead skin cells on the surface of your skin revealing the newer fresher and nicer skin cells underneath This is called exfoliation Your skin already exfoliates itself naturally renewing the upper layer of the skin every 35 weeks But as usual this process slows down and gets faulty with age with exposure to sun pollution and all the usual bad stuff So a little external help in the form of AHAs is usually very helpful And the most awesome part this effect is quick With a quality AHA product you will see pretty much immediate results in terms of fresher smoother skin It can increase collagen synthesisFresher and smoother skin is already awesome enough to make us a fan but what really earned our superstar rating is glycolic acid’s proven ability to increase collagen synthesis There are really only a few ingredients that can do that and glycolic acid is one of them Actually this is the biggest benefit of glycolic acid compared to all the other AHAs The skin firming collagen boosting ability seems to be the best with the smallest and simplest version of all the AHAs probably because being the smallest means also that it can penetrate the deepest But be patient collagen synthesis takes time so this one is a longterm benefit Count as much as 46 month to see some change It reduces hyperpigmentationBrownish spots are usually not something that we want on our face or anywhere else and honestly they are really stubborn things that are hard to fade with cosmetic products But glycolic acid is something that can help to speed up the process Studies show that it can disperse melanin in our skin the natural pigment that gives the color of our skin but too much of it results in brown spots and it’s also very useful for fading the brownish marks left after inflamed acnes it’s called postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or PIHOther nice thingsIf the above was not enough there are a couple of other promising things that glycolic acid can do With ongoing use research shows that it increases the thickness of our skin and helps to stimulate the growth of new skin that results in fresher younger complexion Lifting away dead skin cells from the surface of the skin is also useful to treat dry skin patches and allow all of our other skin care products to perform better Glycolic acid is not a mainstream ingredient for treating acne but even for that you can give it a try There are a few studies that show it can improve problem skin Maybe it’s worth trying in addition to an antiacne skin care routine and not instead of the more effective standard ingredients like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxideOk so glycolic acid is a skincare superstar But to experience all the nice things above it’s important to use a properly formulated highquality product There are two really important things that influence the effectiveness of a glycolic acid or AHA productConcentrationIf you can choose a product where you know the exact concentration of glycolic acid or AHA in it A mild daily use athome product’s concentration should be about 410 With a mild product like that you should see the fresher smoother skin effect but probably not the skinfirming antiaging benefits Products in the 1020 range are still great for at homeuse and should give you all the nice skin benefits that we have detailed out before However they are probably too strong for daily use There is a thing called overexfoliation and that is just not good for your skin Visible peeling redness irritation all signs of overexfoliation do not do that With a stronger product definitely start only once a week or so and if your skin takes it well you can increase to a couple of times a week Above 20 it’s usually professional territory Dermatologists do skin peels at concentration up to 70 Glycolic acid is actually the most popular “lunchtime peel” If you are in need of a more serious skin boost you can run out in lunchtime to a derm and continue to work afterwards with fresher more glowing skin but without any bad visible side effects pH valueIt is at least as important as concentration Or maybe even more important Please buy an AHA product only if you know the pH value AHAs do not work their magic if the product pH is not acidicThe best practice pH range for an at home glycolic acid product is between 34 In this range the product is still effective but it’s also gentle to the skin If the pH is less glycolic acid works stronger if the pH is more it works milder Above pH 4 and especially above pH 5 glycolic acid loses its magic powers On the other hand if the pH is very low it might irritate the skin Professional solutions work at a pH as low as 2 but for at home stick to a 34 pH range Ok almost done A couple of more things to knowIf you use an AHA product please use a sunscreen every morning No wait I rephrase please use a sunscreen every morning in any case But if you use an AHA double make sure that you do that as AHAs increase skin’s sensitivity to sun With stronger products some stinging or burning sensation is normal Your skin gets used to it after a few timesIf your skin is very sensitive or rosacea prone glycolic acid is probably not for you In that case milder BHA and PHA products will be your friendsIf you use AHAs for the first time most probably you will have to experiment a bit to see how often your skin likes it Fresh glowy skin is good Peeling red irritated skin is bad Some people can use a 10 product every day others can use it only once a week So experiment Start slowly and increase frequency rather than the other way around Overexfoliation is not niceSo bottom line glycolic acid is awesome and a superstar Unless you are very sensitive do give it a try if you have not done so yet
353,Glycyrrhiza Glabra  Root Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/glycyrrhiza-glabra-root-extract,You might know licorice as a sweet treat from your childhood but its actually a legume that grows around the Mediterranean Sea the Middle East central and southern Russia Its sweet and yellow and not only used for licorice all sorts but its also a skincare superstar thanks to two magic propertiesNr 1 magic property is that it has skinlightening or to say it another way depigmenting properties The most active part is called glabridin The topical application meaning when you put it on your face of 05 glabridin was shown to inhibit UVB caused pigmentation of guinea pigs Another study even suggested that licorice is more effective than the gold standard skinlightening agent hydroquinone All in all licorice is considered to be one of the safest skin lightening agents with the fewest side effectsThere is just one catch regarding glabridin and licorice the amount of glabridin in commercial licorice extracts can vary a lot We have seen extracts with only 4 glabridin as well as 40 glabridin The latter one is a veryvery expensive ingredient so if you are after the depigmenting properties try to choose a product that boasts its highquality licorice extract Nr 2 magic property is that licorice is a potent antiinflammatory Glabridin has also some soothing properties but the main active antiinflammatory component is glycyrrhizin It’s used to treat several skin diseases that are connected to inflammation including atopic dermatitis rosacea or eczema Oh and one more thing glabridin seems to be also an antioxidant which is just one more reason to be happy about licorice root extract on an ingredient list Bottom line Licorice is a great skincare ingredient with significant depigmenting antiinflammatory and even some antioxidant properties Be happy if its on the ingredient list
354,Haematococcus Pluvialis Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/haematococcus-pluvialis-extract,Haematococcus Pluvialis is a microalgae known for being a rich source of powerful upandcoming antioxidant Astaxanthin The extract comes as a redcolored oily liquid prepared from the resting and astaxanthin accumulating cells of the otherwise green algae As an antioxidant it promises to protect against photodamage and thus help to delay skin photoaging We have written more about Astaxanthin and its benefits here
355,Hamamelis Virginiana  Leaf Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/hamamelis-virginiana-leaf-extract,The extract created from the leaves of the hazelnutbushlikemagictree commonly called Witch Hazel We have gone into detail about Witch Hazel in cosmetic products here its astringent soothing antioxidant and antibacterial but the important part to know about the leaves is that they contain much much less active components than the bark In fact it contains hardly any tannins only 004 and the most active component in the leaves is the antibacterial gallic acid Too many tannins can be very astringent and irritating to the skin so this is not necessarily a bad thing Even the small amount of active components in the leaves seem to give it nice soothing astringent and antibacterial properties You can read much more about witch hazel here
356,Hamamelis Virginiana Bark/​Leaf/​Twig Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/hamamelis-virginiana-bark-leaf-twig-extract,The extract coming from witch hazel that has astringent antiinflammatory antioxidant and antibacterial properties We have written in way more details about Hamamelis Virginiana Extract here
357,Hamamelis Virginiana Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/hamamelis-virginiana-extract,"Witch hazel is a smallish tree up to 5m thats native to NorthAmerica has nice yellow flowers and is similar to the hazelnut bush hence the name As for skincare its loaded with active components that have a bunch of magic properties like astringent antiinflammatory antioxidant and antibacterial Its also a wellknown vasoconstrictor it makes the blood vessels narrower and promotes the healing of broken skin by tightening up the skin proteins and thus creating a protective covering
The complication however is that different extracts and distillates can be made from different parts of the plant bark twigs and leaves are typically used and different extraction methods from different parts produce different results So if you see only Witch Hazel Extract or Witch Hazel Water on the ingredient list its a bit hard to know what youre actually getting but we will try to summarize the possibilities to give an idea
The main biologically active components in Witch Hazel are hamamelitannin a potent astringent and antioxidant catechins antiinflammatory and antioxidant and gallic acid antibacterial The bark extract contains by far the most hamamelitannin and it has the most gallic acid and catechins The twigs contain fewer catechins less gallic acid and much less hamamelitannin 477 vs 018 The leaves contain hardly any tannins 004 or catechins and contain a medium amount of gallic acid compared to the bark and twigs
Witch Hazel also contains tiny amounts of the essential oil and fragrance component eugenol but the amount is so small that its probably not significant for the skin
Apart from the differences in active components in different parts of the Witch Hazel bush the extraction methods also vary Witch Hazel Distillate contains 14 added alcohol according to the USP specifications and alcohol is at best drying and at worst skindamaging Luckily there are also alcoholfree distillates so if you prefer no alcohol check the ingredient list carefully Witch Hazel Extracts can also be made in different ways browsing Ulprospector we could find hydroglycolic hydroalcoholic and glicerinewater based extracts
Wellknown skin care expert Paula Begoun rates witch hazel as poor and says depending on the form of witch hazel you’re exposing your skin either to a sensitizing amount of alcohol or to tannins or both This might be the case if you are dealing with an alcoholic witch hazel bark water or extract but looking at CosIng the official INCI name listing of the EU witch hazel bark water or witch hazel bark extract are not listed ingredients Bark and leaf or bark and twig or all three are used together to create extracts so the chance that there is too much hamamelitannin in the final cosmetic ingredient seems small Also alcoholfree extracts and distillates exist actually the majority seem to be alcoholfree nowadays So all in all we think Hamamelis Virginiana Extract on the ingredient list is nothing to worry about
We even found a German study that compared the efficacy of Hamamelis ointment to panthenol ointment for soothing the skin in children from 27 days to 11 years old They observed 309 children and concluded that both ointments were similarly effective but the one with Hamamelis was even better tolerated 982 vs 923 tolerated well the ointments in the two groups
All in all Witch Hazel Extract is a sloppy INCI name btw not in the CosIng listing and you do not really know what youre getting Most probably though you are getting a goody with nice astringent soothing antibacterial and even antioxidant properties"
358,Hamamelis Virginiana Leaf Water,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/hamamelis-virginiana-leaf-water,"The distillate created from the leaves of the hazelnutbushlikemagictree commonly called Witch Hazel The distillate from the leaves is probably the gentlest most diluted version of any kind of With Hazel ingredient
The leaves contain much much less active components than the bark 477 vs 004 tannins and distillates are more diluted than extracts So this one is probably just a fancywater that resembles the properties of Witch Hazel Extract astringent soothing antioxidant antibacterial in a very mild and gentle way
We have gone into much more details about Witch Hazel here"
359,Hamamelis Virginiana Water,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/hamamelis-virginiana-water,The distillate created from different parts of the hazelnutbushlike magic tree commonly called Witch Hazel Hamamelis Virginiana Water is a bit of a sloppy ingredient name as the leaves the twigs and the bark can be used to create extracts or distillates and the different parts contain different amounts of biologically active components But what you are getting is probably a nice water with astringent soothing antioxidant and antibacterial magic properties We went into great detail about Witch Hazel in cosmetics here detailing the main biologically active components and how they are different in different parts of the plant Click here and read more

362,Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil,"Sunflower does not need a big intro as you probably use it in the kitchen as cooking oil or you munch on the seeds as a healthy snack or you adore its big beautiful yellow flower during the summer or you do all of these and probably even more And by even more we mean putting it all over your face as sunflower oil is one of the most commonly used plant oils in skincare
It’s a real oldie expressed directly from the seeds the oil is used not for hundreds but thousands of years According to The National Sunflower Association there is evidence that both the plant and its oil were used by American Indians in the area of Arizona and New Mexico about 3000 BC Do the math its more than 5000 years – definitely an oldie
Our intro did get pretty big after all sorry for that so lets get to the point finally sunflower oil similar to other plant oils is a great emollient that makes the skin smooth and nice and helps to keep it hydrated It also protects the surface of the skin and enhances the damaged or irritated skin barrier Leslie Bauman notes in Cosmetic Dermatology that one application of sunflower oil significantly speeds up the recovery of the skin barrier within an hour and sustains the results 5 hours after using it
Its also loaded with fatty acids mostly linoleic 5074 and oleic 1435 The unrefined version be sure to use that on your skin is especially high in linoleic acid that is great even for acneprone skin Its comedogen index is 0 meaning that its pretty much an all skintype oil Truth be told there are many great plant oils and sunflower oil is definitely one of them"
363,Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil Unsaponifiables,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil-unsaponifiables,"The unsaponifiable part of sunflower oil Its the small part of the oil that resists saponification the chemical reaction that happens during soap making
If you want to understand saponification more here is a short explanation if not we understand just skip this paragraph Oils are mostly made up of triglyceride molecules a glycerin three fatty acids attached to it and during the soap making process a strong base splits the triglyceride molecule up to become a separate glycerin and three soap molecules sodium salts of fatty acids The fantastic Labmuffin blog has a handy explanation with great drawings about the soapmaking reaction So the triglyceride molecules are the saponifiable part of the oil and the rest is the unsaponifiable part In the case of sunflower oil its about 152 of the oil and consists of skin nourishing molecules like free fatty acids fatty acids not bound up in a triglyceride molecule it contains mainly 4874 according to its spec barrier building linoleic acid tocopherol vitamin E and sterols
According to manufacturers info its an oily ingredient that not only simply moisturizes the skin but also has great lipidreplenishing and soothing properties The clinical study done by the manufacturer on 20 people found that a cream with 2 active increases skin moisturization by 486 after 1 hour and 342 after 24 hours Applied twice daily for 4 weeks the study participants had a major improvement in skin dryness roughness and desquamation skin peeling parameters"

366,Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/hesperidin-methyl-chalcone,"This guy lets just call it simply HMC is a socalled flavonoid flavonoids are natural things found it lots of fruits and vegetables Hesperidin in particular is a flavonone and is found in citrus fruits The methylation of hesperidin gives HMC that has wellestablished blood vessel protecting properties and can be found in drugs that treat problems related to blood vessels
As for skincare there is a mouse study showing HMC has very promising abilities in the treatment of UVB irradiationinduced skin inflammation and oxidative stress or English translation its an antioxidant and antiinflammatory HMC is also part of a 3 active ingredient complex called Eyeliss with Dipeptide2 and Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide7 thats supposed to fight undereye bags The manufacturer claims that in their exvivo test HMC decreased capillary permeability by 25
All in all HMC definitely deserves a goodie status at least as an antioxidant but it might even do something with undereye bags"
367,Hexanoyl Dipeptide-3 Norleucine Acetate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/hexanoyl-dipeptide-3-norleucine-acetate,A new tripeptide meaning that it contains three building blocks called amino acids that can do all kinds of good things for the skin at least according to the ingredients manufacturer Its modest trade name is simply PerfectionPeptide P3 and it can supposedly reactivate the natural desquamation process of the skin Better desquamation means better skin quality with fewer irregularities and imperfections and in general fewer signs of aging It also speeds up cell renewal that results in fresh glowing skin it intensely hydrates refines skin texture and reduces wrinkle depth Hence the name Perfection Peptide Dont forget these are all claims coming from the manufacturer so maybe take it with a little grain of salt
368,Hexapeptide-9,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/hexapeptide-9,An antiaging peptide that can visibly reduce the length and depth of wrinkles at least according to its manufacturer In vitro meaning it was done in the lab not on real people studies show that it enhances epidermal regeneration collagen type I and III synthesis as well as the synthesis of other important skin proteins

377,Homosalate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/homosalate,"An oilsoluble chemical sunscreen agent that protects the skin from UVB 295315 nm with a peak protection at 306 nm Homosalate is not a strong UV filter in and of itself gives only SPF 43 protection at max allowed 10 concentration and it is not photostable looses 10 of its SPF protection in 45 mins so it always has to be combined with other sunscreens for proper protection Its big advantage though is that it is a liquid and is excellent for dissolving other hard to solubilize powder sunscreen agents like the famous Avobenzone
Regarding Homosalates safety profile we do not have the best news Invitro made in the labs studies have shown that it might have some estrogenic activity Do not panic these studies were not conducted on real humans under real world conditions Still if you are a better safe than sorry type be careful when using Homosalate containing sunscreens longterm and fullbody
As of 2020 Homosalate is permitted to be used up to 10 in the EU and 15 in the US but the EU is currently considering restricting it to only 14 probably taking effect from 2022"
378,Honey,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/honey,We all know honey as the sweet gooey stuff that is lovely to sweeten a good cup of tea and we have good news about putting honey all over our skin It is just as lovely on the skin as it is in the tea The great review article about honey in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology writes that it is arguably the oldest skincare ingredient and evidence from around 4500 BC mentions honey in some eye cream recipes Chemically speaking it is a beederived supersaturated sugar solution About 95 of honey dry weight is sugar and the other 5 consists of a great number of other minor components including proteins amino acids vitamins enzymes and minerals This unique and complex chemical composition gives honey a bunch of nice skin care properties it is very moisturizing has soothing and antioxidant abilities as well as significant antibacterial and antifungal magic powers There is also a lot of empirical evidence with emerging scientific backup that honey dressing promotes the healing of wounds and burnsOne tricky thing about honey though is that it can have lots of different floral sources and different types of honey have a somewhat different composition and thus somewhat different properties For example the darker the honey the richer it is in antioxidant phenolic compounds Two special types of honey are acacia and manuka The former is unique and popular because of its higher than usual fructose content that makes it more watersoluble and easier to stabilize in cosmetic formulas The latter comes from the Leptospermum Scoparium tree native to New Zeland and its special thing is its extra strong antibacterial power due to a unique component called methylglyoxal Overall honey is a real skingoodie in pretty much every shape and form and it is a nice one to spot on the ingredient list
379,Honey Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/honey-extract,"Usually a glycerin or glycol based extract of honey that has similar properties to pure honey ie moisturizing soothing and antibacterial magic properties

380,Houttuynia Cordata Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/houttuynia-cordata-extract,"Houttuynia cordata is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia It is eaten as a leaf vegetable and also has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine including as an attempted treatment for SARS it didn’t really work Regarding cosmetics however houttuynia cordata extract has a good bit of potential The main active components in the plant are these fancy chemicals called flavonoids Houttuynia cordata specifically has a good amount of polyphenolic flavonoids four common ones being quercetin quercitrin hyperoside and rutin All of these exhibit antiinflammatory antioxidant and antibacterial properties Quercitrin has also been shown to decrease damage from UVB rays which is an added bonus One thing to keep in mind though is that the flavonoid content of this extract can depend on if the extract is taken from the roots or the leaves as well as if it’s a water extraction or an alcohol extraction
Another thing Houttuynia cordata extract contains are polysaccharides ie big molecules from various sugar units in this case it is galacturonic acid 294 galactose 240 rhamnose 172 arabinose 135 glucuronic acid 68 glucose 53 xylose 21 and mannose 18 Polysaccharides and sugars in skincare are excellent humectants and skin hydrators meaning they help the skin to hold onto water
Last but not least we also found an invitro made in test tubes study showing that houttuynia cordata extract had strong antiallergic effects and could be helpful in treating skin allergies such as eczema atopic dermatitis"
381,Human Adipose Derived Stem Cell Conditioned Media,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/human-adipose-derived-stem-cell-conditioned-media,If you see some kind of cell conditioned media on the ingredient list it always means a Growth Factor Cocktail for your skin In this case we are talking about AdiposeDerived Stem Cells ADSC ie cells that differentiate later into fat cells These cells are known to secrete various growth factors that have significant wound healing and antioxidant propertiesIf you are new to Growth Factors they are medium long amino acid sequences small proteins big peptides that work as a cell signaling molecules to stimulate cell growth proliferation healing andor differentiation The whole Growth Factors and skincare topic is pretty big and somewhat confusing so if you want to dip your toes into it we have a shiny description at Epidermal Growth Factor the first GF that found its way into cosmetic products and also at Human Fibroblast Conditioned Media a GF Cocktail similar to this one but coming from different type of cells
382,Human Fibroblast Conditioned Media,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/human-fibroblast-conditioned-media,"Human Fibroblast Conditioned Media HFCM essentially means a Growth Factor Cocktail for your skin We have written more about the most common GF used in skincare the Epidermal Growth Factor here so if you are new to the topic head over there to catch up The TLDR version is that a Growth Factor is a medium long amino acid sequence small protein big peptide that works as a cell signaling molecule to stimulate cell growth proliferation healing andor differentiation Ingredients called Conditioned Media cover not one but a mix of Growth Factors derived from some cells grown in a lab In the EU human cellderived ingredients are illegal so GF products available in the EU usually use a plant source eg barley In the US humanderived GFs are all OK and Human Fibroblast Conditioned Media is derived as its name suggests from human fibroblast cells VIP skin cells for collagen production The company Skinmedica was a pioneer in using GFs in cosmeceutical skincare and their version of HFCM contains a proprietary mixture of growth factors cytokines and soluble matrix proteins secreted by cultured neonatal human dermal fibroblasts during the production of extracellular matrix ECM It is claimed to be a physiologically balanced mix of GFs that are ideal for skin cells to regenerate themselves More specifically it contains growth factors that can promote angiogenesis VEGF and hepatocyte growth factor modulate inflammation IL6 and IL8 and enhance ECM deposition TGFβ1 and plateletderived growth factorA Skinmedica has pretty convincing research showing that their products containing GFs TNS line work and have great antiaging benefits Multiple clinical studies show that the TNS Recovery Complex improves the appearance of fine lines wrinkles skin tone and texture The benefits are even greater when GFs are combined with tried and true antiaging actives such as antioxidants and retinol
This all sounds really good however GFs in skincare are somewhat controversial As potent mitogenic stimulates cell proliferation molecules you should not use them if you have any of the skin cancer risk factors high or if you have psoriasis We have written more about the concerns at EGF Overall Growth Factors have increasing evidence both proper clinical studies as well as some GF products with a cult following showing that they have great antiaging benefits Whether you are comfortable with using humanderived ingredients or if you feel the cons outweigh the pros is up to you If you are a better safe than sorry type daily SPF retinol is still the golden standard of antiaging"
383,Hyaluronic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/hyaluronic-acid,"It’s naturally in our skin and behaves there like a sponge It can bind up to 1000 times its own weight in water It is a big molecule from repeated subunits polymer so different molecular weight versions exist unfortunately there is no way to determine MW from INCI list only HighmolecularweightHA 500 kDa is an excellent surface hydrator skin protectant and can act as an osmotic pump helping watersoluble actives to penetrate deeper into the skin LowmolecularweightHA 500 kDa can hydrate the skin somewhat deeper though it is still a big molecule and works mainly in the epidermis outer layer of the skin LowmolecularweightHA might also help the skin to repair itself by increasing its selfdefense 200kDa used in the study UltralowmolecularweightHA 50kDa is a controversial ingredient and might work as a proinflammatory signal molecule Hyaluronic acid HA and its various forms are the current ITmoisturizers So let’s see what is hyaluronic acid and even more importantly what’s the big deal about it
HA is a nice big sugar molecule from repeated subunits polymer that can be found naturally in our body It’s the most dominant and most important molecule in the liquidy stuff between our skin cells the sciency name for it is the extracellular matrix or ECM A 70 kg adult has about 15 g of HA in her body and half of it is in the skin Most of the skin HA is in the dermis the deeper layer about 05 mgkg but there is also some in the epidermis the upper layer about 01 mgkg
Saying it’s a big molecule doesn’t do it justice By default it’s a HUGE molecule Its molecular weight can be up to 4 million Dalton that is just the unit molecular weight is measured in To compare normal table sugar that you bake with has a molecular weight of 340 Dalton Because HA is a polymer its subunits can be repeated many times or just a few times and thus different molecular weight versions exist There is not a super clear definition what counts as high molecular weight or low molecular weight but it seems to be roughly like this High molecular weight HA or HMWHA 500k 4M Dalton
Low molecular weight HA or LMWHA 500k Dalton and below HMWHA in the skin First you have to know that this is the version that can mostly be found in our skin So what does it do
Think of it as a sponge HMWHA has superstar waterbinding abilities It can bind 1000 times its own weight in water Or to say it another way 1 gram of HA can bind up to 6 liters of water That is a lot and this makes HA pretty much the best waterbinding ingredient we know today It is really the sponge of our skin it’s there in the outer layers and helps our skin immensely to attract and retain its water content Not only that but HA has lots of other important biological functions Apart from hydration the skinrelated functions include maintaining the skins elasticity reducing the skins inflammatory response regenerating the damaged skin barrier and plumping up waterloss related wrinkles Essentially helping the skin to look and feel healthy and young HMWHA put on your face As for smearing HMWHA all over our face you have to know that most probably it does not penetrate the skin There is a lonely study from 1999 that thinks that HA can absorb into the skin through some active transport mechanism however we could not find anything to confirm this What we could find is multiple expert opinions and newer studies that state HMWHA is a huge molecule that stays on top of the skin to give surface hydration and to form a protective barrier Not only that but it can also work as an osmotic pump meaning it can be a penetration enhancer for watersoluble actives As the cosmetic chemist at Realize Beauty puts it HA can be an osmotic delivery system that can push watersoluble actives deeper into the skin by forming a highly hydrated reservoir on the surface of the skin LMWHA in the skin The biological function of LMWHA in the skin seems to be crazy complicated and different than that of HMWHA LMWHA is mostly created when HMWHA is chopped up into smaller pieces at sites of an injury and it is thought to be a proinflammatory signal molecule that says danger danger bring on some inflammation and repair yourself LMWHA put on your face Based on LMWHAs biological role the question is logical is LMWHA proinflammatory when we smear it on Well it is a good question and we do not have the surefire answer Most evidence points so far to a no at least when it comes to molecular weights in the 50kDa and up range First LMWHA is still a bigbig molecule whose penetration is questionable It might absorb a bit better than HMWHA but that still means working mostly in the epidermis the uppermost layers of the skin Second we found multiple studies showing that LMWHA can help the skin to repair itself One study showed that 02 LMWHA 200kDa used in the study increases the skins selfdefense and another two studies found LMWHA also in 02 to be helpful for inflammationrelated skin diseases such as rosacea and facial seborrheic dermatitis
Third a manufacturerrelated study done by Evonik found that HA versions with a molecularweight of 50kDa and up do not induce inflammatory signals in the skin however the 20kDa version did show some proinflammatory activity Granted this was done on reconstituted human epidermis so it might or might not be like this on real human skin BTW they also found invivo on real people that the LMWHA versions especially the one with 50kDa MW can plump up wrinkles really good So based on LMWHAs biological role and the Evonik study you might want to be careful with ultralow molecular weights the ones below 50kDa However this is also not a sure thing We also saw manufacturer data showing that a 10kDa molecular weight HA version has better antioxidant activity than a 16MDa version and it also had better sun protection and aftersun repair abilities than the higher MW versions We really cannot tell you the surefire answer Our best guess is that if you are a cautious type avoid the ultralow MW versions but normal LMWHA seems to be all OK to us Phweeew that was really long and complicated sorry for that If you are still with us congrats Youve just become a real HAandtheskin expert"
384,Hydrogen Dimethicone,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/hydrogen-dimethicone,A silicone molecule that is halfway between Dimethicone and Methicone meaning that some of the methyl CH3 groups are replaced with a hydrogen atom in Methicone half of the CH3 groups are replaced This makes Hydrogen Dimethicone a handy pigment bonding agent used for the hydrophobization treatment of powders as the H atoms can absorb traces of water from the surface of pigmentsIt almost always comes stuck together with either Titanium Dioxide Zinc Oxide or Mica In suncare products it binds to physical UV filters to maximize their protection while minimizing any white casts It also has good chemical stability with no irritation In makeup it is often paired with Mica where it offers nice hydrophobic properties and improves skin adhesion meaning it will make it easier for products to stay where they should be
385,Hydrogenated Castor Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/hydrogenated-castor-oil,"A chemically modified version of castor oil that results in a solid waxy material that serves as an emollient and consistency building material
It also has some unique moisturizing properties as it is both occlusive and humectant The former one is common for oils and waxes and it means that it sits on top of the skin hindering water to evaporate out of the top layers The latter one the humectant property is surprising and comes from the unique property of ricinoleic acid the dominant fatty acid in castor oil having an extra waterloving OH group on its otherwise oilloving fatty chain We have some more info about this at castor oil so if you are interested read on here"
386,Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/hydrogenated-coco-glycerides,"A white solid vegetablederived fat meaning it has the same triglyceride structure as oils but is solid at room temperature that contains coconutderived C12C18 chain length saturated no double bonds fatty acids

394,Hydrolyzed Placental Protein,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/hydrolyzed-placental-protein,A chemically chopped up version of protein coming from bovine placenta yes it is an animalderived ingredient Proteins are long amino acid chains so when you chop them up you get peptides short aminoacid chains and amino acids nice molecules that are known as the building blocks of life In general amino acids peptides and proteins are moisturizing nourishing and regenerating ingredients when you smear them on your face so is probably Hydrolyzed Placental Protein According to manufacturers information it also works as a film forming protecting and restructuring agent Due to its high amino acid content it improves surface hydration and elasticity and due to its larger peptide and protein molecules it forms a nice film on the skin that reduces transepidermalwaterloss ie hinders water evaporating out of the top layers of the skin These effects help to maintain the water content of the skin cells and result in a healthy skin nice complexion
395,Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/hydrolyzed-sodium-hyaluronate,"Its a super small chemically chopped up version of sodium hyaluronate Its trade name is miniHA and its molecular weight is 10 kDa This counts as really tiny given that normal HA has a molecular weight of 052 million Da
To be honest low molecular weight LMW and especially this ultralow molecular weight HA is a controversial ingredient On the upside it can penetrate the skin better though 10kDa still counts as big and might be able to moisturize the deeper layers of the skin where normal HA cannot get Also according to the manufacturer of miniHA it has better antioxidant activity than a 16MDa version HA and it also has better sun protection and aftersun repair abilities than the higher MW versions It also works in synergy with higher molecular weight versions and the combination of 01 145MDaHA 01 380 kDaHA 01 miniHA hydrated the skin significantly better than 03 145MDaHA alone
On the downside the biological role of LMWHA in the skin is being a proinflammatory signaling agent and there is a study by another manufacturer called Evonik showing that HA versions with smaller than 50kDa molecular weight might be proinflammatory when put on the skin Granted the study was only done on reconstituted human epidermis so it might or might not be like this on real human skin If you wanna get confused and read much more about hyaluronic acid and what the different molecular weight versions might or might not do click here and read our excruciatingly long description"

409,Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/hydroxypinacolone-retinoate,"Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate HPR is the newest member of the royal family of skincare see who is who on this cool retinoids family tree the retinoid family The queen of the family is the FDAapproved antiaging superstar retinoic acid aka tretinoin and HPR seems to be a gentle but influential sister princess to the queen
Good to know the trade name of HPR is Granactive Retinoid The manufacturer produces it as 10 active and 90 solvent called dimethyl isosorbide When a product claims 2 Granactive Retinoid it means 02 Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate and 18 dimethyl isosorbide on the ingredient list Its a socalled retinoic acid ester meaning that its directly related to retinoic acid If youve already read our description about retinol or retinyl palmitate you know that the active ingredient our skin cells can interpret is retinoic acid Other forms of retinoids have to be converted by our metabolic machinery to do something Thats not the case with HPR It binds directly to the retinoid receptors of the skin cells to work its skincare magic The big promise of HPR is that its similarly active as retinoic acid no conversion needed remember but without the irritation According to the manufacturers tests 24 hours of an occlusive patch with 05 HPR resulted in significantly lower irritation than 05 retinol Also there was a dramatic reduction of lines and wrinkles after applying 02 HPR around the eyes twice a day for 14 days
These results sound sooo promising that we dont blame you if you wanna run out right now and get an HPR formula to slather on your face But before you do you have to know that the info we have about HPR at the moment is mainly from the manufacturer whose tests may or may not be accurate or properly designed such as controlled doubleblind and conducted on an appropriate number of people As HPR is pretty new there isnt that much independent research we could find yet We found two Italian studies both examining the efficacy of HPR combined with other things retinol in both cases and papain in one of them for the treatment of acne Both studies found the formulas effective but they contained other things too so its hard to judge how well HPR did
Regarding antiaging there is a pretty recent Estee Lauder sponsored study that compared the invitro not on real human beings but on skin models collagenboosting effectiveness of Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate tretinoin good old retinol and retinyl palmitate RP The results are pretty encouraging showing that HPR had greater levels of gene transcription than retinol and RP RP at the same concentrations however HPR did not achieve gene transcription levels of ATRA tretinoin But a much higher dose might be tolerated from HPR and the highest dose of HPR outperformed tretinoin Pretty encouraging though we are very much waiting for a study to confirm all this on real human beings Bottom line We are really happy to see some innovation happening with retinoids and we think Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate is a super promising rising star but it’s not fully proven yet If you are someone who likes to experiment and try out the newest things grab your running shoes and try some HPR containing serum now see product list below If you like the tried and true however stick to retinol and tretinoin for now and reexamine the question in a couple of years when hopefully more research will be available Are you into Retinoids Read our shiny description about other members of the retinoid family Retinyl Propionate the most promising retinol ester out there
Retinyl Retinoate a super interesting retinolretinoic acid hybrid molecule

414,Imperata Cylindrica Root Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/imperata-cylindrica-root-extract,A subtropical plant that thrives in flooded environments and is claimed to give excellent longterm moisturizing effects Its hydrating ability is due to the chemical composition of the rhizomes that contain natural osmoprotective compounds such as 3dimethylsulfoniopropionate DMSP potassium starches and sugars Osmoprotective compounds are interesting skincarewise as they are thought to be able to increase intracellular osmosis meaning water is drawn into the skin cells According to the efficacy data from the manufacturer 2 of ABS Imperata Cylindrica Extract the trade name of the diluted version of the root extract is able to increase the level of skin moisturization by almost 45 which is 88 more effective than the untreated control This all sounds great however in terms of comparative effectiveness Imperata Cylindrica came up somewhat short in the study published in the Journal of cosmetic dermatology They compared four hydrogels with different moisturizer actives and although all the formulas did hydrate the skin the one with Imperata Cylindrica extract performed less well than the same formula with urea or sugarbased hydrating trio called Aquaxyl Still it is a skin goodie with nice moisturizing properties so if you are after skin hydration it is a good one to spot on the INCI list

445,Lactic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/lactic-acid,"It’s the second most researched AHA after glycolic acid It gently lifts off dead skin cells to reveal newer fresher smoother skin It also has amazing skin hydrating properties In higher concentration 10 and up it improves skin firmness thickness and wrinkles Choose a product where you know the concentration and pH value because these two greatly influence effectiveness Don’t forget to use your sunscreen in any case but especially so next to an AHA product Lactic acid is the second most wellknown and most well researched among the AHAs The no 1 is glycolic acid If youre new to AHAs we strongly suggest that you head over to our description about glycolic acid There you will find a super detailed geeky description and many of the things we wrote are true to all AHAs and to lactic acid as well Here we will focus mainly on the differences But before we dive in just a short intro
Lactic acid is probably one of oldest actives about which women have noticed that it has some nice benefits to the skin Legend has it that in ancient Egypt Cleopatra bathed in sour milk And yes you guessed it right sour milk is a major natural source of lactic acid As an AHA it’s also true of lactic acid that it can gently lift away dead skin cells revealing the fresher smoother nicer skin underneath This is an awesome property of AHAs and this alone makes us a total fan
But just like glycolic acid lactic acid also knows some more However the “some more” is a bit different for the two of them The differences stem from the fact that the molecule of lactic acid is larger
Because of the larger molecule it can penetrate the skin less effectively This means on the one hand that lactic acid is more gentle and on the other hand that the antiaging properties are probably a little less effective While the collagen boosting ability of lactic acid is not so well proven there are studies that show that it also has great antiaging properties if used in the right concentration at the right pH A study done in 1996 compared a 5 and a 12 lactic acid treatment and examined their effect on the outer epidermis and middle dermis layer of the skin The result was that both treatments had nice exfoliation effect but the 5 treatment only affected the epidermis while the 12 treatment affected both the dermis and the epidermis Another study has compared multiple AHAs including lactic acid and glycolic acid in terms of skin benefits and skin irritation The result was that both of them are very effective AHA versions more effective than citric malic and hydroxybutyric acids and after six weeks of use both lactic and glycolic acid improved skin firmness thickness and wrinkles to a similar extent This study also compared the different versions of lactic acid L and D Lactic acid is like our hands it has “a left and a righthanded” version Surprisingly these two versions are not equal the Llactic acid showed the same effectiveness with less irritation potential so that version is the better choice for a cosmetic product BTW the reason for this is not understood Other than that lactic acid has one more magic property it’s an amazing moisturizer ingredient In fact it’s so great with moisturizing and treating dry skin that in the USA there is even an FDAapproved prescription product called LacHydrin that contains 12 lactic acid to hydrate skin As for choosing the right product concentration and pH value is very important here too You can read in detail about both things at the glycolic acid description The exact same thing is true for lactic acid pH 34 is the best for athome products The other goodtoknow things listed out at glycolic acid also apply here The only difference it’s more gentle so probably it will cause less stinging or burning though it depends on the concentration and pH of course So bottom line lactic acid is also a superstar It’s a gentle moisturizing AHA that can give you a fresh smooth even complexion and also some antiaging benefits You have to give it a try if you have not done so so far"

This particular form is obtained by fermenting the pumpkin fruit with lactobacillus lactis During the fermentation many of the complex biomolecules are broken down into isolated phytochemicals and selective filtration techniques are used to isolate the proteolytic parts The result is pumpkin enzyme that is a gentle exfoliator that can be an alternative to AHAs According to the manufacturer 4 glycolic acid has a similar effect on cell renewal as 5 pumpkin enzyme In an irritation test the ingredient did not irritate even the sensitive eye tissue and was hardly more irritating than glycerin
All in all pumpkin enzyme seems to be a promising gentle alternative to acid exfoliation"
453,Lactobacillus/​Punica Granatum Fruit Ferment Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/lactobacillus-punica-granatum-fruit-ferment-extract,"Its the fancy name for pomegranate enzyme thats obtained by fermenting the pomegranate fruit with Lactobacil­lus lactis The fermentation process makes the desired phytochemicals readily available and selective filtration techniques are used to isolate the proteolytic frac­tions
The end result is the enzyme that increases cell renewal and can be an alternative to acid exfoliation though it is not as effective as glycolic acid even according to the manufacturers measurements not to speak about the other benefits of glycolic acid"
454,Lactobionic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/lactobionic-acid,"Lactobionic acid is the brother or maybe the sister of gluconolactone Usually it’s called a PHA though some studies call it bionic acid or aldobionic acid Not that this matters too much What matters is that it’s similarly awesome to gluconolactone So go read about gluconolactone to get the idea
In a nutshell it’s a next generation AHA with almost all the benefits and more and without the irritation It gently lifts off dead skin cells and makes your skin smooth and even It moisturizes and helps the skin barrier Can be used on sensitive skin too or post cosmetic procedure In the long run it has antiaging benefits though a tad less than AHAs and it’s even an antioxidant Must try just like the other AHAs"
455,Lactococcus Ferment Lysate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/lactococcus-ferment-lysate,"Lactococcus Ferment Lysate is a fairly new probiotic ingredient that is obtained from the Grampositive bacteria Lactococcus lactis The lysate is a fluid substance that is produced when you break down the cell membrane which means it contains interesting things including cytoplasm and cell wall fragments
According to the manufacturer it positively influences both the speed and quality of epidermal growth that results in better barrier function and overall skin quality To prove their point the German manufacturer conducted several invitro made in test tubes tests examining how the treatment with Lactococcus Ferment Lysate LFL affects important skin proteins
They found that gene expression influencing the proteins binding the live skin cells together such as Occludin Desmocollin 1 and Desmoglein 1 is stimulated by LFL as well as the expression of enzymes Kallikrein 5 and 7 breaking the bonds between the shedding dead skin cells LFL also had a positive influence on epidermal growth and on the thickness of the stratum corneum the outermost layer of the skin Another positive finding was that LFL stimulated the production of antimicrobial peptides that play an important role in the immunocompetence of the skin cells
As for invivo tests the manufacturer only did one and that had only 5 volunteers They did some tape stripping exactly what it sounds hurting the skin by stripping off the top layers and examined skin renewal and barrier recovery 4 days after the experiment 3 Lactococcus Ferment Lysate used twice daily resulted in thicker stratum corneum the difference was about 2 µm and less transepidermal water loss Overall Lactococcus Ferment Lysate is a promising but fairly unproven ingredient that might help with the natural skin renewal process as well as with a healthy skin barrier and skin flora"

464,Lavandula Angustifolia Flower Water,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/lavandula-angustifolia-flower-water,"In general flower waters are diluted versions of essential oils meaning they contain pretty much the same components but in muchreduced concentrations So lavender flower water is a highly diluted version of lavender essential oil According to manufacturer claims its traditionally used as bath water or wash water and might be useful for acneprone or oily skin thanks to lavenders antibacterial properties
We wrote in detail about lavender essential oil and why we prefer it not to have in skincare products in short it not only contains fragrant components but research shows it might be cytotoxic even at low concentrations so we would also be cautious with the lavender water Its much more diluted so less effect and less side effect but why risk it"

466,Lavandula Angustifolia Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/lavandula-angustifolia-oil,We have to start by writing how fascinated we are by the amazing lavender fields of Provance and we do love pretty much everything about lavender its look its color its scent but when it comes to skincare lavender is a questionable ingredient that you probably do not want in your skincare productsFirst let us start with the pros it has a lovely scent so no wonder that it is popular as a fragrance ingredient in natural products wanting to be free from synthetic fragrances but still wanting to smell nice The scent of lavender is famous for having calming and relaxing properties and some smallish scientific studies do support that Inhaled volatile compounds seem to have a soothing effect on the central nervous system and studies have shown that lavender aromatherapy can improve patients anxiety and experience in hospitals Another pro is that lavender oil has some nice antimicrobial and antibacterial properties It also has some local pain relieving and muscle relaxing magical powers Lavender oil is also often claimed to have antiinflammatory properties We have found a study confirming this but it was the essential oil of the leaves and not the much more commonly used flowers and the two differ in their main chemical compounds very much The main components of the flower essential oil are linalyl acetate and linalool around 80 the two together while it is 18Cineole around 65 in the essential oil of the leavesNow let us look at the cons similar to a bunch of other essential oils the main components of lavender oil are potentially irritating fragrant components The two main components are linalyl acetate about 50 and linalool about 35 and both autoxidise on exposure to the air forming strong contact allergens To make things even worse lavender oil seems to be cytotoxic from concentrations as low as 025 concentration up to 0125 were ok There is also an often cited Japanese study that made patch tests with lavender oil for 9 years and found a huge increase in lavender oil sensitivity in 1997 from 11 in 1990 to 87 in 1997 and 139 in 1998 This was the year when using dried lavender flowers in pillows wardrobes and elsewhere became fashionable in Japan so it seems that increased exposure to lavender results in increased risk of sensitivityOverall it makes us sad to write bad things about such a lovely plant but when it comes to skincare you will be better off without lavender
467,Lecithin,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/lecithin,A very common ingredient that can be found in all cell membranes In cosmetics its quite the multitasker its an emollient and waterbinding ingredient but its also an emulsifier and can be used for stabilization purposes Its also often used to create liposomes

The main antibacterial active in tea tree oil is terpinen4ol 40 while manukas main actives are socalled cyclic triketones such as Leptospermone Isoleptospermone and Flavesone 2030 Both oils are antibacterial and antifungal but in different ways
While tea tree oil is a pretty well established antiacne ingredient manuka has more of a might be useful status for problem skin Its strong suit is treating fungal infections such as athletes foot nail bed infections or foot odor Other than that manuka can help to relax muscles useful for treating muscle and joint pain and also has some antioxidant activity"

475,Limonene,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/limonene,A super common and cheap fragrance ingredient Its in many plants eg rosemary eucalyptus lavender lemongrass peppermint and its the main component about 5090 of the peel oil of citrus fruitsIt does smell nice but the problem is that it oxidizes on air exposure and the resulting stuff is not good for the skin Oxidized limonene can cause allergic contact dermatitis and counts as a frequent skin sensitizer Limonenes nr1 function is definitely being a fragrance component but there are several studies showing that its also a penetration enhancer mainly for oilloving componentsAll in all limonene has some pros and cons but especially if your skin is sensitive the cons probably outweigh the pros
476,Linalool,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/linalool,"Linalool is a super common fragrance ingredient It’s kind of everywhere both in plants and in cosmetic products It’s part of 200 natural oils including lavender ylangylang bergamot jasmine geranium and it can be found in 9095 of prestige perfumes on the market The problem with linalool is that just like limonene it oxidises on air exposure and becomes allergenic That’s why a product containing linalool that has been opened for several months is more likely to be allergenic than a fresh one
A study made in the UK with 483 people tested the allergic reaction to 3 oxidised linalool and 23 had positive test results"
477,Linoleic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/linoleic-acid,The famous omega6 fatty acid the mother of all ω6 fatty acids in our body It is a socalled polyunsaturated fatty acid meaning it has more than one in this case two double bonds and a somewhat kinky structure that makes LA and LArich oils a thin liquidIt is also an essential fatty acid meaning our body cannot synthesize it and has to take it from food This is not hard at all as plenty of nuts such as flax poppy or sesame seeds and vegetable oils such as sunflower or safflower are rich in LA The hard thing seems to be eating enough omega3s more specifically eating a healthy ratio of omega6 to omega3 but that is a topic for a whatisgoodtoeatsite and not for us As for linoleic acid and the skin LA is a really important little guy found naturally in our skin It is the most abundant fatty acid in the epidermis and it serves as a structural precursor for important skin lipids called ceramides Knowing this it will not come as a surprise that Linoleic acid has a central role in the structure and function of stratum corneum permeability aka healthy skin barrier LA deficiency leads to an impaired more permeable skin barrier and the topical application of LArich sunflower oil can fix this issue rapidly while oleicrich olive oil did not have the same barrier repairing effectLA is not only important for dry barrier damaged skin types but also for acneprone skin Research shows that problem skin has lower levels of linoleic acid and higher levels of oleic acid than normal skin So LAdeficiency in the skin seems to be connected not only to an impaired skin barrier but also to acne and smearing LA all over your face might help with your problem skin A doubleblind study using a 25 LA gel for 4 weeks found a 25 reduction in the size of microcomedones the tiny blocked pores that can later lead to acneIf that was not enough we have one more thing to report about LA It lightens hyperpigmentation aka UVB caused sun spots both by blocking the melanin production of melanocytes the skin cells that make the pigment melanin and by enhancing the desquamation of melanin pigment from the upper layers of the skinOverall linoleic acid is a multifunctional skin goodie with barrier repairing acnereducing and skinlightening magic abilities Its a nice one to spot on the ingredient list pretty much for any skin type
478,Linolenic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/linolenic-acid,The famous omega3 fatty acid the mother of all ω3 fatty acids in our body Next to linoleic acid it is the other essential fatty acid that our body cannot synthesize and we have to ingest it from our food It is also a PUFA aka polyunsaturated fatty acid with three double bonds a kinky chemical structure and thus a liquid consistencyWhile linoleic acid is abundant in the skin this is not the case with alphalinolenic acid ALA It is not entirely clear if it is meant to be like that or if this is a consequence of not eating enough Omega3 with the typical Western dietLeafy green vegetables walnuts flax seeds and fish oils are rich sources of ALA and if you are not eating a lot from these supplementing with fish oil is a pretty good idea backed by research It is a good idea both in terms of general health benefits as well as potentially improving inflammationrelated skin issues such as atopic dermatitis or acneAs for using ALA topically we have to say that its role and effects seem to be less direct than with LA ALAs main role in the skin appears to be modulating the immune response of the epidermis This is probably helpful for inflammatory skin diseases but most studies examine ALA as an oral supplement and not when applied topically One exception we could find is a study that found that topically applied ALA has nice spotfading abilitiesTo be honest it seems to us that oral supplementation of ALA is more important than smearing it all over your face However that is not to say that topical ALA is a bad thing it is a good thing It is a skinidentical ingredient it is probably moisturizing and antiinflammatory but its topical effects are less established than that of fellow omega fatty acid linoleic acid
479,Linum Usitatissimum Seed Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/linum-usitatissimum-seed-oil,The oil coming from the plant Linum Usitatissimum or commonly called Flax If you are into healthy eating you probably know flaxseeds as a rich source of hardtoeatenough omega3 fatty acids or if you are into fashion you probably have some light summer cloth made from linenAs for skincare flaxseed oil is one of the few natural plant oils that is a rich source 3565 of moisturizing and probably antiinflammatory ω3 fatty acid aka linolenic acid It also contains skinnourishing oleic acid 1135 and barrier repairing linoleic acid 1124 According to manufacturer claims it is used as an emollient antiinflammatory and healing agent and it is wellknown to create smooth and soft skin

As for Lonicera Japonica Flower Extract in skin care it can have two main roles The first one is being an antiinflammatory and soothing ingredient probably due to chlorogenic acid a polyphenol thought to be the main bioactive component of the flower
The other possible role is being a natural preservative If this is the case it is coupled with its Italian Honeysuckle cousin to form a broad spectrum antimicrobial preservative blend You can read about this more here"

Regarding the three magic abilities of pure vitamin C antioxidant collagen booster skin brightener there is no published data about MAPs antioxidant or photoprotection capabilities We have better news about the other two things invitro data shows that MAP can boost collagen synthesis similar to AA though in the case of AA its proven invivo and even better MAP is proven to work as a skin brightener invivo on real people Bottom line when it comes to vitamin C derivatives MAP is definitely an option We especially recommend it if you are after skin brightening as this seems to be the strongest point of MAP"

495,Mandelic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/mandelic-acid,"Mandelic acid is an AHA that comes from bitter almond It can gently lift off dead surface skin cells and make the skin more smooth and even It has antibacterial properties It’s promising against acne and post inflammatory hyperpigmentation It’s light sensitive so choose a product with opaque packaging An AHA that comes from bitter almond and is named after the German name of almond “mandel” If you have never heard of AHAs where have you been then go ahead and read all about the most famous representative glycolic acid We will wait When it comes to skincare you have to know about AHAs So go and read it and let’s meet here afterward
Hey welcome back Now that you are an AHA and especially a glycolic acid expert we will just focus on the main differences between mandelic acid and glycolic acid The first difference is that mandelic acid has a bigger molecular structure than glycolic acid Because of this it can penetrate less deeply and works more on the skin surface Most probably this is the reason why mandelic acid is more gentle on the skin But this does not mean that mandelic acid is not an effective exfoliator It is It can gently lift off dead skin cells from the surface that results in smoother and more even complexion Compared to glycolic acid the exfoliation action is slower but also safer Even sensitive skin types tolerate mandelic acid pretty well Another distinct feature of mandelic acid among the AHAs is that it has wellknown antibacterial properties Because of this its a promising ingredient in treating acne Also mandelic acid has effective skin brightening properties and it seems to be particularly effective in lightening post inflammatory hyperpigmentation PIH
A study from 2009 has compared a 35 glycolic acid peel with 20 salicylic acid 10 mandelic acid peel SMP on skins with active acne and post acne scarring and hyperpigmentation SMP proved to be more effective both in treating acne lesions and hyperpigmentation and with fewer side effects Of course salicylic acid is a superstar ingredient but still it is a promising result for mandelic acid Another promising study for mandelic acid and its ability to fight acne is a Polish study from 2015 Its not an independent study and its also not placebocontrolled or double blind but still better than nothing It examined the effectiveness of 5 and 10 mandelic acid for 60 days and found that both are safe and effective for the treatment of acne Mandelic acid was the most effective at decreasing the number of pustules 60 in 60 days but it also worked to a lesser extent for inflammatory nodules 30 and comedones 20
Other good to know things are pretty similar to other AHAs it’s effective at home pH range is 34 you should use a sunscreen next to it and experiment a bit how much and how often your skin can tolerate it According to manufacturer info daily use is suggested up to 10 Oh one more thing as opposed to glycolic acid mandelic acid is light sensitive so choose a product with proper opaque packaging Bottom line mandelic acid is a less researched but a very promising AHA Just like other AHAs it gently exfoliates but it also has antibacterial effect and seems to be an especially good choice for acne prone problem skin"
496,Mangifera Indica Seed Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/mangifera-indica-seed-oil,"The soft solid offwhite to ivory butter or oil coming from the kernel the seed inside of the seed of the Mango Similar to many other plant oils its a great moisturizing and nourishing emollient oil It has medium spreadability and gives skin a creamydry feel Its loaded with a bunch of goodfortheskin stuff it contains almost all of the essential amino acids has several antioxidant phenolic compounds including famous antioxidant ferulic acid and is a rich source of nourishing fatty acids like stearic and oleic acid
All in all a skin goodie especially for dry skin types"
497,Mannitol,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/mannitol,A type of sugar molecule that has waterbinding properties and helps to keep your skin hydrated
498,Mannose,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/mannose,Mannose is one of the many sugar molecules out there and similar to the other ones it works as a great humectant and moisturizer in cosmetic products
499,Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/melaleuca-alternifolia-leaf-extract,When it comes to Tea Tree the essential oil is the one that steals the show with its welldocumented antimicrobial and antiacne effects The extract is not very well defined and it probably contains the active components of the oil in muchreduced concentrations Manufacturers still mention soothing antimicrobial purifying and antiseptic properties for the tea tree extract
500,Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/melaleuca-alternifolia-leaf-oil,"The famous tea tree oil One of the best known essential oils which comes from Australia where it has been used for almost 100 years for its antiseptic and antiinflammatory actions Legend has it that the medicinal benefits of the oil were considered so important that Australian soldiers were supplied with some tea tree oil in their World War II military kit
Similar to other essential oils tea tree oil is a very complex chemical mixture consisting of about 100 components the major ones being terpinen4ol 40 γTerpinene 23 and αTerpinene 10 Terpinen4ol is considered to be the main active component but as a great article in Clinical Microbiology Reviews states while some TTO components may be considered less active none can be considered inactive and most components contribute to TTOs strong antibacterial antiviral and antifungal effects Regarding skincare and tea tree oil its most wellknown effect is probably being a well established antiacne ingredient Multiple studies confirm that TTO is effective against the evil acnecausing bacteria called P acnes and the effectiveness of 5 TTO gel is comparable to the gold standard antiacne treatment 5 Benzoyl Peroxide lotion You need to be a bit more patient with TTO though as its effects come slower but also with fewer side effects
Regarding TTO and sensitive skin we say that you should be careful Even if your skin is not sensitive you should never put undiluted TTO on your skin Luckily it contains only very small amounts of the common allergens such as limonene but irritant and allergic reactions still happen especially by oxidation products that occur in older or not properly stored oil So if you have some pure TTO at home know that storage matters keep it in a cool dry dark place and use it up in a reasonable amount of time
Overall we do not often give a goodie status to essential oils but we feel that TTOs unique antibacterial and antiacne properties with its minimal allergen content warrant an exception If your skin is acneprone TTO is something to experiment with"
501,Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Water,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/melaleuca-alternifolia-leaf-water,"The muchmuch diluted version of the famous Tea Tree Essential Oil the socalled hydrosol that is created as a byproduct of steamdistillation used for producing essential oils In general hydrosols contain the same components as their big sister essential oil but in wayreduced concentrations We have seen a specification saying 99 of the tea tree water is water and about 1 consists of very small amounts of the dissolved essential oil and the watersoluble parts of the tea tree leaves
So tea tree water might have some soothing antibacterial and antiacne properties but much less strong than the essential oil"
502,Melaleuca Leucadendron Cajuputi Leaf Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/melaleuca-leucadendron-cajuputi-leaf-oil,The essential oil coming from a tree that belongs to the same family as more skincarefamous Melaleuca Alternifolia aka Tea Tree The main component of the Cajeput Oil is 18Cineole about 65 that has antiviral antimicrobial as well as penetration enhancer abilities On the con side topical use of 18Cineole has local irritant properties and can induce edema so the pros might not worth the cons especially if your skin is sensitive
503,Melaleuca Teretifolia Branch/​Leaf Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/melaleuca-teretifolia-branch-leaf-oil,An essential oil with a lemony scent with warm honey notesContains fragrant components among others citral geranial neral so it might be a good idea to avoid if your skin is sensitive
504,Melissa Officinalis Leaf Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/melissa-officinalis-leaf-oil,The essential oil from the leaves of lemon balm It has a sweet fresh citruslike fragrance that is lovely to smell but when it comes to skincare its a mixed bag Thanks to its tannin and polyphenol components it has antiviral antibacterial and antifungal effects Invitro made in the lab not on people studies have also shown that it has high concentrations of antioxidants The downside is that 5070 of the oil consists of fragrant components citronellal geranial and neral that might irritate sensitive skin
505,Mentha Piperita Leaf Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/mentha-piperita-leaf-oil,Some variation of peppermint essential oil known for its grassyminty smell and refreshing sensations Its main active component is menthol a known skin irritant Read more here
506,Mentha Piperita Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/mentha-piperita-oil,The essential oil coming from steam distillation of freshly harvested flowering peppermint sprigs Its major component is menthol that gives the oil its wellknown refreshing and cooling properties Peppermint oil is traditionally used as an inhalant for cold and coughs and there is also some clinical data validating its use against headaches by rubbing a peppermint oil cream on the forehead As for skincare other than the nice grassyminty smell and the refreshing sensations we cannot write good things It can be a skin irritant so much so that it is a wellknown counterirritant for muscle pains creating mild surface irritation to make things better in the deeper layers But for everyday skincare counterirritation is not something you wanna do so we think that peppermint oil is better to avoid especially if your skin is sensitive
507,Menthol,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/menthol,"Menthol needs no introduction its the thing that causes the cooling sensation so wellknown both from cosmetic products as well as a bunch of other things like chocolate chewing gum toothpaste or cigarette Its a natural compound that comes from the essential oil of Mentha species peppermint oil contains 4050 menthol and it gives them their typical minty smell and flavor
As for skincare menthol seems to be a mixed bag Apart from the cool cooling sensation that might last up to 70 mins it also has painkilling itch reducing antibacterial antifungal and even penetration enhancing properties On the other hand it also seems to act as a skin irritant that increases transepidermal water loss the water that evaporates from the outer layer of the skin and thus contributes to drying out the skin"
508,Methicone,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/methicone,Bearing a close relationship to the famous Dimethicone Methicone is the slightly trimmed down version missing the methyl CH3 groups on one side of the silicone chain Like most silicones it has nice emollient properties and improves the spreadability of productsBut Methicones main thing in practice is not being an emollient but a silicone fluid for hydrophobization treatment of powders ie making solid powders mineral filters color pigments very water resistant and easily spreadable Methicone does this by absorbing traces of water from the surface of pigments that is very useful for mineral sunscreens and makeup products
509,Methoxycinnamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/methoxycinnamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine,A colorless odorless liquid that works as a watersoluble UVB filter with a peak protection of 306 nm Chemical sunscreen agents are typically oilsoluble so being watersoluble is unique and it makes it possible to create cosmetically elegant nonoily nontacky silky and smooth feeling formulas It is also used as a color protectant in hair care formulationsWe could not figure out its regulatory status as a sunscreen agent though Its manufacturer only says its registered as a new cosmetic ingredient in the EU but it is probably not an officially approved sunscreen filter yet
510,Methyl Diisopropyl Propionamide,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/methyl-diisopropyl-propionamide,A molecule that gives a longlasting cooling and chilling effect to the formula It is not derived from menthol and according to the manufacturer is not allergenic

516,Methyl Trimethicone,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/methyl-trimethicone,Methyl Trimethicone is a very light volatile silicone it evaporates from the skin rather than absorbs into it thats similar to super commonly used Cyclopentasiloxane but it dries even faster when applied to the skin
517,Methylchloroisothiazolinone,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone,This totally unpronounceable ingredient let’s take a shortcut MCI is a super effective preservative with both antibacterial and antifungal effects that works at very low concentrations The bad news with it though is that it can sensitize the skin easily it’s a socalled nonfragrance allergen It’s not permitted to be used alone but only with its BFF methylisothiazolinone MI another icky preservative Together they have a broad spectrum antimicrobial effect but are permitted to be used only in rinseoff products under 00015
518,Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/methylene-bis-benzotriazolyl-tetramethylbutylphenol,"The long name covers a nice sunscreen agent and quite a special one at that Its a hybrid sunscreen meaning its halfway between physical the ones that at least partly reflect the sun and chemical agents that absorb the rays which most sunscreens do It is a new generation UV filter and just like its sister Trinosorb S it is not available in the US It gives nice broadspectrum coverage 280400 nm meaning UVB as well as UVA protecion with peak protection at 305 nm and 360 nm and it is highly photostable It can also help to stabilize other less stable sunscreens like Octinoxate and is generally happy to work together with other UVfilters
Its hybrid nature means that it is organic like the chemical agents but it is neither water nor oil soluble and works as a suspension of micro fine particles If the small particles scare you we have good news the safety profile of Tinosorb M is great It is not absorbed into the skin and unlike some other chemical sunscreens it does not show estrogenic activity The downside of its hybrid nature is that similar to the inorganic sunscreens zinc and titanium dioxide Tinosorb M also leaves a white cast on the skin that can be bothersome on darker skin tones"
519,Methylglucoside Phosphate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/methylglucoside-phosphate,Its a pretty new antiaging ingredient that is a safe and preactivated source of energy to feed aging skin cells Its part of an antiaging complex trade named Neodermyl where methylglucoside phosphate is combined with the essential amino acids proline lysine and also copper This complex is claimed to be able to increase the collagen I and III production of skin and even more surprisingly also the elastin production Both slow down with age and beeing able to boost the skins own production of these super important proteins results in improved skin firmness and elasticityThis is a very big deal especially the elastin part as there is not yet a clinically proven active ingredient that is able to boost the skins own elastin production There are also very few ones think vitamin C glycolic acid and retinol that are proven to boost collagen The claims about Neodermyl are not yet confirmed in independent studies but the manufacturer did do some very convincing testing that showed a visible reduction of wrinkle depth and volume in just 15 days If you are into antiaging this is a new active that might be worth a try

521,Methylisothiazolinone,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/methylisothiazolinone,"As you may guess if something is only recommended in products that you rinse off cleansers and shampoos then it’s probably not the best ingredient for the skin
Methylisothiazolinone MI is a preservative that super efficient against bacteria at surprisingly low concentrations The problem with it though is that it can also sensitize and irritate the skin quite easily when it comes in leaveon formulas
Currently some countries are considering to ban it entirely like Denmark and the permitted use level is very low under 001 Luckily there are plenty of products on the market with other preservative options so if you are a better safe than sorry type its probably best to avoid it"
522,Methylparaben,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/methylparaben,The most common type of fearedbyeveryonemostlywithoutscientificreason parabens Its a cheap effective and welltolerated ingredient to make sure the cosmetic formula does not go wrong too soon Apart from the general controversy around parabens we wrote about it more here there is a 2006 invitro made in the lab not on real people research about methylparaben MP showing that when exposed to sunlight MP treated skin cells suffered more harm than nonMP treated skin cells The study was not done with real people on real skin but still using a good sunscreen next to MP containing products is a good idea Well in fact using a sunscreen is always a good idea
523,Methylpropanediol,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/methylpropanediol,Its a type of glycol that according to the manufacturer is an extremely good replacement for other glycols like propylene or butylene glycol Its main job is to be a solvent but it has also very good antimicrobial properties and acts as a true preservative booster Also helps with skin hydration without stickiness or tacky feel

532,Myristoyl Nonapeptide-3,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/myristoyl-nonapeptide-3,"A newish peptide with the promise of mimicking the effects of the skincare superstar retinol vitamin A but without its negative side effects Similar to retinol Myristoyl Nonapeptide3 is claimed to increase cell turnover and to promote the synthesis of collagen but without skin irritation or stinging To back up its claim the German manufacturer did a socalled gene array screening test where they examined the effect of the molecule on 96 skinrelated genes They did screening for both retinoic acid the active form of retinol and our guy Myristoyl Nonapeptide3 They found that retinoic acid upregulates 21 of the 92 studied genes and amongst those 16 genes are also upregulated by Myristoyl Nonapeptide3 So they trade named the molecule as Retinopeptide 189 as in a peptide that mimics the effects of retinoic acid To further prove their point Symrise the manufacturer went ahead and did some exvivo testing meaning testing on human skin explants They compared a 01 retinoic acid solution with 5 and 10 Retinopeptide 189 cream and found that the 10 cream induces a significant increase 43 in collagen1 that is comparable to the effect of 01 retinoic acid which performed even better with more than a 50 increase They also found that both retinoic acid 01 and Retinopeptide 189 5 cream increased epidermal cellular layers in the skin explants showing that both ingredients can increase cell turnover however retinoic acid did significantly better both in active effects as well as side effects
Unfortunately there are currently no invivo test results at least with could not find any so if you prefer the tried and true stick with retinol However if you are the adventurous type or if your skin is sensitive and cannot tolerate retinoids Myristoyl Nonapeptide3 is a promising alternative"

541,Niacinamide,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/niacinamide,"A multifunctional skincare superstar with several proven benefits for the skin Great antiaging wrinkle smoothing ingredient used at 45 concentration Fades brown spots alone or in combination with amino sugar acetyl glucosamine Increases ceramide synthesis that results in a stronger healthier skin barrier and better skin hydration Can help to improve several skin conditions including acne rosacea and atopic dermatitis Niacinamide or as us normal people call it vitamin B3 is a real skincare superstar that has had so many studies and has so many skin benefits that we have to warn you that this geeky details description will not be short Just as an intro a couple of thing about the stuff itself its a watersoluble vitamin that usually comes in white powder form It is odorless and has a salty bitter taste It can be found in meat fish wheat and small amounts in vegetables The version used in cosmetics is produced exclusively synthetically
Lets look at all those skin benefits
1 Antiaging wrinklesmoothing properties With age our skin tends to slow down in many ways One of them is in producing important proteins such as keratin filaggrin and involucrin at a slower rate Reduced amounts of these proteins results in poorer skin structure reduced skin elasticity and more wrinkles Studies show that niacinamide can boost collagen production as well as the production of these three important proteins That means improved skin structure and fewer wrinkles FYI antiaging studies usually use 45 niacinamide daily for 812 weeks so if you are after the antiaging benefits try to choose a product that tells you the exact percentage of niacinamide it contains 2 Skinlightening properties Hyperpigmentation or brown spots are really stubborn and honestly it can be really hard to make them disappear just by topical products What you can expect for them is to fade a little and niacinamide is a great ingredient to help with that Studies show that 25 niacinamide used daily for 8 weeks results in significant lightening of hyperpigmentation When combined with amino sugar acetyl glucosamine the results are even better
Whats more niacinamide as a skin lightener works in a way different to most others It suppresses the transfer of melanosomes little spheres carrying the melanin pigment from melanocytes skin cells producing the melanin to keratinocytes skin cells in the top layer of the skin while most other skin lighteners block an enzyme called tyrosinase that plays an important role in melanin production So if you want to mount a multifront attack on the brown spots you can combine a niacinamide treatment with tyrosinase inhibitors like vitamin C arbutin or kojic acid
3 Barrier repair functions the skin barrier is the outer layer of the skin that is amazingly important at keeping the skin hydrated and healthy The stuff between the skin cells consists mainly of free fatty acids cholesterol and ceramides The amount and structure of these determine how healthy the skin barrier is What studies have shown is that 2 niacinamide can increase the synthesis of free fatty acids cholesterol and ceramides that result in healthier and stronger skin barrier decreased transepidermal water loss and better hydrated skin
4 Antiacne properties though niacinamide does not count as one of the gold standard antiacne ingredients if you have problem skin its totally worth a try It has sebum regulating and antiinflammatory properties and a study that used 4 niacinamide for 8 weeks to treat acne found that 82 of those treated showed some improvement Whats more the results were slightly better than with a 1 clindamycin gel an antibiotics often used to treat acne
5 Other notable things if the above four things are not enough to convince you about niacinamide here are some more reasons Studies show that vitamin B3 can help to speed up epidermal cell growth that slows down with age it can help with wound healing it can smooth the structure of the skin and it has also antibacterial and photo protective properties Plus it might also be useful for rosacea and atopic dermatitis probably because of its antiinflammatory property Well that was long Hope we could convince you that niacinamide is a skincare superstar and a musttry for pretty much everybody"

Its chemical structure is monounsaturated meaning it has one double bond cis9 that makes it less kinky than polyunsaturated fatty acids with multiple double bonds Less kinkiness means that oleic acid and OArich oils are a bit thicker and heavier than their LArich siblings
Maybe this thickness is the reason that Oleic acid is considered comedogenic and if you have acneprone skin avoid OArich plant oils and choose linoleic acidrich versions instead
The thickness of OA also means that OArich oils are considered more nourishing and moisturizing than their LArich counterparts and are generally considered to be more suitable for dry mature skin types As for oleic acid in its free form and by free we mean that it is not bound up in a triglyceride structure like it is in oils it mostly serves as an emulsifier or emulsion stabilizer in small amounts in regular cosmetic products It is also quite well researched and is used in the pharmaceutical industry as a penetration enhancer"

612,Parabens,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/parabens,"Unless you live under a rock you have probably heard of parabens Until about 10 years ago they were the most commonly used preservatives as they are nonirritating very effective and cheap Then 2004 came and a research paper came out that tested 20 human breast tumors and found parabens in all of them This was before the era of social media btw its the year Facebook was founded but this research still managed to go viral and caused parabens to become the evil cancercausing preservative in peoples head
Cosmetic companies do want to do what we want to buy and as we did not want to buy products containing parabens anymore they started to use alternatives like the current ITpreservative phenoxyethanol Its much easier to replace parabens than trying to go into lengthy explanations about why the 2004 research is misunderstood and how there are lots of data showing that parabens are totally ok
As people got so interested the FDA wrote a little article about parabens stating theFDA believes that at the present time there is no reason for consumers to be concerned about the use of cosmetics containing parabens
We think the above is pretty much the gist of the topic but if you feel like reading about parabens all day today here is a handy list for you to get you started Parabens on Wikipedia

613,Paraffinum Liquidum,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum,"The famous or maybe rather infamous mineral oil The clear oily liquid that is the cheap byproduct of refining crude oil and the one that gets a lot of heat for its poor provenance It is a very controversial ingredient with pros and cons and plenty of myths around it So let us see them The pros of mineral oil Trust us if something is used for more than 100 years in cosmetic products it has advantages Chemically speaking cosmetic grade mineral oil is a complex mixture of highly refined saturated hydrocarbons with C1550 chain length It is not merely a byproduct but rather a specifically isolated part of petroleum that is very pure and inert
It is a great emollient and moisturizer working mainly by occlusivity Occlusivity is one of the basic mechanisms of how moisturizers work and it means that mineral oil sits on top of the skin and hinders socalled transepidermal water loss ie water evaporating out of your skin When compared to heavyduty plant oil extra virgin coconut oil the two of them were equally efficient and safe as moisturizers in treating xerosis a skin condition connected to very dry skin
The other thing that mineral oil is really good at is being nonirritating to the skin The chemical composition of plant oils is more complex with many more possible allergens or irritating components while mineral oil is simple pure and sensitivity to it is extremely rare If you check out the classic French pharmacy brands and their moisturizers for the most sensitive allergy prone skin they usually contain mineral oil This is no coincidence The cons of mineral oil The pros of mineral oil can be interpreted as cons if we look at them from another perspective Not penetrating the skin but mostly just sitting on top of it and not containing biologically active components like nice fatty acids and vitamins mean that mineral oil does not nourish the skin in the way plant oils do Mineral oil does not give the skin any extra goodness it is simply a nonirritating moisturizer working mainly by occlusivity The myths around mineral oil Badmouthing mineral oil is a favorite sport of many it is a cheap material and being connected to petrolatum makes it fairly easy to demonize While it is true that industrial grade mineral oil contains carcinogenic components socalled polycyclic compounds these are completely removed from cosmetic and food grade mineral oil and there is no scientific data showing that the pure cosmetic grade version is carcinogenic
What is more in terms of the general health effects of mineral oils used in cosmetics a 2017 study reviewed the data on their skin penetration and concluded that the cosmetic use of mineral oils and waxes does not present a risk to consumers due to a lack of systemic exposure Another super common myth surrounding mineral oil is that it is comedogenic A 2005 study titled Is mineral oil comedogenic examined this very question and guess what happened The study concluded that based on the animal and human data reported along with the AAD recommendation it would appear reasonable to conclude that mineral oil is noncomedogenic in humans Overall we feel that the scaremongering around mineral oil is not justified For dry and supersensitive skin types it is a great option However if you do not like its origin or its heavy feeling or anything else about it avoiding it has never been easier Mineral oil has such a bad reputation nowadays that cosmetic companies hardly dare to use it anymore"

If you google PG or you like to read around on sites advocating natural cosmetics you might have read some really scary info about this ingredient The two most common accusations are that it’s a strong skin irritant and that it modifies the skin to allow toxins to penetrate it
As for the first one yes PG can be a skin irritant if used 100 on your skin but so can many things in their pure 100 form Think about salt It’s not the same if you try to eat it in itself or if you put a pinch of it on your food So PG used in small amounts in cosmetics is just fine according to every credible scientist and toxicology expert As for the second thing that PG allows toxins to get through our skin it is somewhat true that PG might help some ingredients to penetrate the skin better But it does not work so that a tiny amount of PG allows all the bad stuff to go right into our blood English cosmetic chemist Colin wrote a very good post about this He writes that the skin is very good at keeping things out and getting some good ingredients into it is actually not easy According to his experience PG is not a very good penetration enhancer and fairly large 1025 amount is needed for this function But more than 10 can be irritating so it’s very rare that a cosmetic product contains this large amount The scientists at the Beauty Brains are even more accepting of PG They write that PG is safe for ingestion it can be a food additive AND safe for use in injected drugs so it’s unlikely to cause any problems in a topical cosmetic product applied on intact skin
All in all PG is a helper ingredient and is not especially good for your skin But used in small 5 amounts it’s absolutely fine not poisonous and there is no reason to be afraid of it If you would like to read some more about PG here is the opinion of skin care expert Paula Begoun cosmetic chemists Colin and the Beauty Brains all really good info on the topic"

726,Retinal,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/retinal,"If you are reading here we are pretty sure the words retinoids and retinol ring a bell but if not you are seriously missing out please click here immediately to catch up The TLDR version is that retinoids are the royal family of skincare with tretinoin being the queen the only FDAapproved ingredient to treat the signs of photoaging Retinol is like a grandkid it has to be converted through two steps in the skin to become retinoic acid The conversion means retinol is both less effective and less harsh on the skin So where does our current molecule Retinal aka Retinaldehyde fit into the family btw here is a nice visual family tree about who is who Remember that retinol needed two conversion steps to become retinoic acid Yes you are right Retinal is the intermediate step between retinoic acid and retinol meaning it needs only one conversion step to become active in the skin If we go with our royal family analogy Retinal is Prince Charles directly next in line to the throne Once retinal is converted it becomes retinoic acid and does the same things we detailed in our tretinoin description In a nutshell it is everything you expect from an antiaging superstar such as decreased wrinkles smoother firmer and more elastic skin This sounds good but how does Retinal compare to retinoic acid Good question We found a study a pretty good one with 125 patients that compared 005 retinal with 005 retinoic acid and vehicle They concluded that at week 18 a significant reduction of the wrinkle and roughness features was observed with both retinaldehyde and retinoic acid and the difference between the two was not statistically significant Interestingly in both groups the results were less significant at week 44 so it might be a good idea to have a retinoid break from time to time Also our guy Retinal was much better tolerated than retinoic acid known for its harshness The good tolerability of retinal was also confirmed by another study that compared retinol ROL retinal RAL and retinoic acid RA They found that the natural retinoids ROL and RAL do have a good tolerance profile in contrast with the irritating potential of RA meaning retinal is an awesome alternative if you have irritation and flaking issues with prescription products such as RetinA Last but not least we want to mention a pretty big but subjectively evaluated Avene the French pharmacy brand famous for its Retinal products sponsored study that examined the tolerability and efficacy of a 01 Retinal 6 glycolic acid product in the treatment of acne The product was added next to the standard antiacne regimen of 1709 patients for 90 days and the study concluded that the formula was both very well tolerated as well as effective next to other standard antiacne medications such as benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics
Overall if you are into retinoids Retinal is a really awesome and wellproven member of the family that is absolutely worth trying"
727,Retinol,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/retinol,"Retinol pure Vitamin A is probably the most proven antiaging ingredient available OTC It has to be converted in the skin to retinoic acid to work its magic Once converted it has the same effect as alltransretinoic acid aka tretinoin A generally accepted ballpark number is that retinol is 10to20 times less potent than retinoic acid It makes skin less wrinkled smoother firmer and tighter It might also be helpful for acne prone skin as it normalizes keratinization and makes the pores produce less sebum Possible side effects and irritation are also much less than with retinoic acid Do not use whilst pregnant If you like to read about skincare and if you are here it seems that you do we are sure that you have already read a lot about retinol It is the ingredient everyone keeps talking about and there is a reason for that it is the most proven antiaging superstar available over the counter
If you want to dig a bit deeper and really understand retinol you have to start with tretinoin We have written a nice geeky description about it so click here and read all about it
So now you know that tretinoin or retinoic acid as its often called is the real proven FDAapproved antiaging magic ingredient and tretinoin and retinol are both retinoids They are not exactly the same but they belong to the same family With that in mind we will focus here on the differences and on how the antiaging effect of retinol measures up against the antiaging effect of tretinoin Retinol vs tretinoin the big difference
Tretinoin is so damn effective because our skin cells have socalled retinoid receptors that interact directly with tretinoin but they cannot interact with retinol Retinol itself is not active and it has to be converted to retinoic acid to actually do something In theory our skin has metabolic machinery to do the conversion which is a twostep process retinol retinaldehyde retinoic acid
Once the conversion is complete retinol becomes tretinoin and can do the same thing as we have detailed in our tretinoin description BUT this twostep conversion process is not very effective and the effectiveness varies from person to person This means that retinol is much weaker than tretinoin and its also possible that retinol doesnt do much for you because your skin is a lazy converter while tretinoin still happily works Retinol vs tretinoin effectiveness
So retinol in theory becomes retinoic acid in the skin and from there it can work its tretinoinmagic There are several studies proving that retinol does exhibit biological activity and causes similar changes to the skin than tretinoin 01 retinol concentration gives already nice results but the question is more the extent of the effects Luckily there are a few studies to give us an idea A study from 1997 compared the penetration and the effectiveness of retinol and retinoic acid and found that retinol penetrates better and retinol at 025 may be a useful retinoid for application without occlusion because it does not irritate but does induce cellular and molecular changes similar to those observed with application of 0025 retinoic acid Another 2015 study confirms the ballpark number that retinol is about 10 times less potent than tretinoin It compared 025 05 and 10 retinol with the commonly available tretinoin concentrations 0025 005 and 01 The authors of the study concluded that results from this comparison study suggest that this sustainedrelease retinol complex containing multiple agents for optimal irritation control provides comparable improvements to tretinoin in the appearance of photo damage
A third study that we think is interesting and worth mentioning is one that did not try to determine what concentration of retinol is similar to what concentration of retinoic acid but went the other way and compared the effects of equal concentrations 01 of retinol and retinoic acid The result of this study was that topical retinol treatment induces similar changes in skin histology and skin related gene and protein expression as seen with retinoic acid application and the magnitude is more than half of that from retinoic acid treatment Of course not only the antiaging effects but the side effects like irritation skin flaking dryness redness are also milder with retinol A mild retinol product around 01 is still proven effective and very tolerable You have to be more careful introduce it gradually with stronger versions around 1 retinol where both the effects and the side effects can come close to that of tretinoin Bottom line Retinol is not the same as retinoic acid or tretinoin Its less potent but still works great If you are into antiaging and like the tried and true and are not pregnant a good retinol or retinoid product should be in your skincare routine"
728,Retinyl Palmitate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/retinyl-palmitate,"Its an ester form of vitamin A retinol palmitic acid that belongs to the retinoid family The retinoid family is pretty much the royal family of skincare with the queen being the FDAapproved antiaging ingredient tretinoin Retinol is also a very famous member of the family but its like Prince William two steps away from the throne Retinyl palmitate will be then little Prince George quite far 3 steps away from the throne By steps we mean metabolic steps Tretinoin aka retinoic acid is the active ingredient our skin cells can understand and retinyl palmitate RP has to be converted by our metabolic machinery to actually do something The conversion is a 3 step one and looks like this
retinyl palmitate retinol retinaldehyde alltransretinoic acid
As we wrote in our lengthy retinol description the problem is that the conversion is not terribly effective The evidence that RP is still an effective antiaging ingredient is not very strong in fact its weak Dr Leslie Baumann in her fantastic Cosmetic Dermatology book writes that RP is topically ineffective Whats more the antiaging effectiveness is not the only questionable thing about RP It also exibits questionable behaviour in the presence of UV light and was the center of a debate between the nonprofit group EWG whose intentions are no doubt good but its credibility is often questioned by scientists and a group of scientists and dermatologists lead by Steven Q Wang MD director of dermatologic surgery at MemorialSloan Kettering Cancer Centre Dr Leslie Baumann wrote a great review of the debate and summarized the research available about retinyl palmitate here It seems that there is a study showing RP being photo protective against UVB rays but there is also a study showing RP causing DNA damage and cytotoxicity in association with UVA We think that the truth lies somewhere in the middle and we agree with Dr Baumanns conclusion sufficient evidence to establish a causal link between RP and skin cancer has not been produced Nor I’m afraid are there any good reasons to recommend the use of RP We would add especially during the day
Bottom line If you wanna get serious about retinoids RP is not your ingredient retinol or tretinoin is However if you use a product that you like and it also contains RP there is no reason to throw it away If possible use it at night just to be on the safe side"
729,Retinyl Propionate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/retinyl-propionate,"Retinyl Propionate RP is a less wellknown but pretty interesting member of the retinoids aka the royal family of skincare You can read the whos who here but the TLDR version is that tretinoin is the queen herself the FDAproven antiaging active molecule retinol is like Prince William two conversion steps needed to be active and Retinyl Palmitate is like little Prince George three conversion steps needed to be active Similar to Retinyl Palmitate Retinyl Propionate is also a retinol ester with retinol and propionic acid being attached together This puts our molecule in the place of little Princess Charlotte on the family tree quite far away from the throne However not all retinol ester molecules are made equal when it comes to being transformed and being effective on the skin
As Dr Fulton the scientist behind both RetinA and RP puts it in his patent paper Other esters of vitamin A obtained from for example palmitic acid and acetic acid do not have the therapeutic advantages found with vitamin A propionate Presumably the Retinyl Palmitate molecule is so large it is not able to transdermally reach the necessary part of the skin for activity Similarly vitamin A acetate is too small molecularly and therefore easily recrystallizes from any solutionvitamin A propionate is the appropriate molecular weight and configuration to both remain in a stable solution and to be transdermally delivered to a site where it is active So while the effectiveness of other retinol esters is highly questionable Retinyl Propionate seems to be the most effective retinol ester molecule and it unexpectedly provides all the benefits of vitamin A acid but minimizes the negative side effects at least according to Dr Fulton the inventor of the molecule We know what you are thinking This sounds great and all but what about some proof Some backup data not from the inventor himself We looked into it and found three studies working with Retinyl Propionate
In a 2007 study by Dr Draelos she references a 12week doubleblind placebocontrolled clinical trial that compared the effectiveness of 015 retinol with 03 Retinyl Propionate Both actives were effective in reducing the appearance of facial wrinkles and hyperpigmentation and the 03 RP worked a bit better Another research that was done by Procter Gamble combined multiple antiaging actives including niacinamide peptides and 03 of Retinyl Propionate and they compared this regimen with a 002 tretinoin regimen They found that the cosmetic regimen was tolerated better worked faster and gave comparable results All this sounds very promising for RP however it is hard to know how much the other actives contributed to the positive results Last but not least there is a study from 1998 that tested a 015 Retinyl Propionate cream and after 24 weeks found no statistically significant difference between the effects of the retinyl propionate cream and the placebo preparation for any of the clinical parameters of skin photoaging However after 48 weeks the 015 RP worked wonders for actinic keratoses a rough scaly patch caused by UV damage its name contains actinic but it is not acne has nothing to do with it So it seems that the minimum effective dose of Retinyl Propionate is larger than 015 which is not surprising given that it has to do three conversion steps to reach the active form retinoic acid But 03 RP or more obvs seems to be an effective dose and even though the proof is not as solid as it is for retinol itself if you are looking for a more gentle alternative or if you are in the mood for experimentation Retinyl Propionate looks like a noteworthy alternative and the most promising option among retinol esters"
730,Retinyl Retinoate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/retinyl-retinoate,Retinyl Retinoate RR is a less well known but super interesting member of the retinoids vitamin A derivatives aka the royal family of skincare Unless you live under a skincarenewsshielding rock you must have heard about tretinoin the FDAapproved antiaging superstar and retinol the most common OTC version of tretinoin You can read more about whoswho in the retinoid family hereEnter Retinyl Retinoate a molecule that is created by attaching retinol to retinoic acid The attachment makes the molecule more stable pure retinol is unstable and hard to formulate as well as more active If you read our shiny description about retinol you will know that it is not active and has to be converted by our metabolic machinery to become retinoic acid the biologically active molecule The conversion is not very effective and takes two steps Retinyl Retinoate also has to be converted but in the first step our cells break up the molecule to become retinoic acid the active and retinol meaning that it becomes active both after the first conversion step as well as later on once retinol is further converted The Korean research group who invented the molecule did several studies published in wellrespected journals to prove that Retinyl Retinoate has better antiaging activity than retinol In marketing materials RR is often touted to be 8 times as active as retinol but as far as research goes we can cite that the biological activity of retinyl retinoate was in between the properties of retinol and retinoic acid Retinyl retinoate showed higher biological activity than that of retinol such as RAR activity and collagen synthesis Also retinyl retinoate showed a similar sideeffect to that of retinol and not retinoic acidAs for invivo aka done on real people studies there is one from 2010 that compares 006 Retinyl Retinoate to placebo and to 0075 retinol The conclusion of this study was that 006 RR is significantly more effective than placebo or retinol and RR also had a fasteracting effect Another study in test tubes mouse skin concluded that RR increases the Hyaluronic acid production more than other retinoids and is also less of an irritant RR shows promise for treating acne In an 8 week doubleblind clinical study 005 retinyl retinoate showed a significant decrease in both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions and in sebum amount It even had some activity against Pacnes that makes it a promising ingredient for acne prone skin especially when combined with other activesOverall we find Retinyl Retinoate a very interesting and promising member of the retinoid family It is not as proven as good old retinol the multiple studies on RR come from the same research guys but it promises several advantages more stable more active less irritating so we say that if you like retinoids RR is worth trying
731,Ricinus Communis Seed Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/ricinus-communis-seed-oil,"Castor oil is sourced from the castor bean plant native to tropical areas in Eastern Africa and the Mediterranean Basin It is an ageold ingredient it’s over 4000 years old with many uses including as a shoe polish food additive and motor lubricant You would be reasonable to think that putting shoe polish on your face wouldn’t be the best idea but it turns out castor oil has some unique properties that make it a stalwart in thick and glossgiving formulas think lipsticks and highlighters
So what is so special about it The answer is its main fatty acid called ricinoleic acid 8595 Unlike other fatty acids ricinoleic acid has an extra waterloving part aka OH group on its fatty chain that gives Castor Oil several unique properties First it is thicker than other oils then its solubility is different eg dissolves in alcohol but not in mineral oil and it allows all kinds of chemical modifications other oils do not hence the lots of Castor oilderived ingredients It is also more glossy than other oils in fact it creates the highest gloss of all natural oils when applied to the skin Other than that it is a very effective emollient and occlusive that reduces skin moisture loss so it is quite common in smaller amounts in moisturizers While it is very unlikely and this is true for pretty much every ingredient cases of reactions to castor oil have been reported so if your skin is sensitive it never hurts to patch test"
732,Rosa Canina Fruit Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/rosa-canina-fruit-oil,Though it says fruit oil in its name the rosehip fruit contains the seeds that contain the oil So this one is the same as Rosa Canina Seed Oil or Rosehip Oil known for its high omega fatty acid content linoleic acid 51 linolenic acid 19 and oleic acid 20 and skinregenerative properties There is a common misconception that rosehip oil contains vitamin C as the fruit itself does but vitamin C is a watersoluble vitamin hence it is not contained in the oil The antioxidant and regenerative properties of the oil probably come from the oilsoluble tocopherols vitamin E and carotenoids provitamin A Read more here
733,Rosa Canina Seed Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/rosa-canina-seed-oil,"The oil coming from the seeds of dogrose a wild rose species native to Europe northwest Africa and western Asia Its a nice emollient moisturizing plant oil loaded with skinnourishing fatty acids linoleic acid 51 linolenic acid 19 and oleic acid 20 If you start to dig a bit deeper into the rosehip oil topic you will soon see that there are lots of species of rose and its all a bit confusing to know what the differences and similarities between the oils of the different roses are As far as our research can tell here is the gist
In skincare two major types of rosehip oil are used
1 Rosa Rubiginosa that is a synonym for Rosa Eglanteria and for Rosa Mosqueta We will call it RR from now on 2 Rosa Canina or RC
The oil content and composition of RR and RC is similar but there are some differences RR contains 8 of oil while RC contains a bit more 10 However the quality of RR oil seems to be a bit better it contains 78 essential unsaturated fatty acids while RC contains only 71 Also the linoleicoleic ratio of RR is better 33 vs 25 that might be important if your skin is acneprone as linoleic acid is good for acne and oleic is not There is one more important thing to mention RR oil is famous for containing the miracle active tretinoin Though Wikipedia puts RR and RC oil under the same article called as Rose hip seed oil the referenced research about tretinoin content examines only Rosa Rubiginosa We looked for a research paper explicitly stating that Rosa Canina also contains tretinoin but could not find one so we can neither deny nor confirm it What we could find is a paper mentioning the tocopherols vitamin E and carotenoids provitamin A content of Rosa Canina oil that gives it some nice antioxidant properties
All in all it is a great emollient plant oil with great fatty acids beneficial for any skin type"
734,Rosa Damascena Absolute,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/rosa-damascena-absolute,"The super concentrated version of Rose Essential Oil you can read here a bit more about what an absolute is and how its prepared
So what we wrote there is pretty much true here as well its very expensive smells heavenly but its a mixed bag when it comes to skincare On the upside it has antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds and on the downside most if it is fragrant compounds that might hurt sensitive skin types"
735,Rosa Damascena Flower Cera,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/rosa-damascena-flower-cera,"Its a waxy solid material coming from Rose In general floral waxes are created in the same process as floral absolutes An absolute is a super concentrated version of an essential oil Instead of distillation a solvent extraction method is used First an organic solvent is added to the plant material Second this solution is filtered and concentrated and a waxy mass called concrete is produced Third the concrete is treated in alcohol and the soluble fraction becomes the absolute while the insoluble parts give the floral wax
So the Rose Wax is a solid emollient with some protecting and softening power It does not contain too much of the fragrant compounds read more at the essential oil as most of them are in the absolute but if your skin is very sensitive it still might be better to avoid it"
736,Rosa Damascena Flower Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/rosa-damascena-flower-oil,We are big fans of all kinds of roses as ornamental plants but when it comes to skincare it is a mixed bag Before we list out the good and the not so good here is an interesting thing The oil content in rose is very very low so distilling rose essential oil requires huge amounts of rose flowers It has such a wonderful scent that there are no comparable synthetic alternatives You can probably guess that this means rose essential oil is expensive very very expensive So the good things thanks to its wonderful scent the highend perfume industry loves rose oil Also we humans love rose oil We love its scent so much that it can heal headaches depression stress and even grief Rose oil contains more than 95 compounds among them flavonoids anthocyanins vitamin C and quercetin that are all known for their medicinal properties and great antioxidant effects Similar to many other essential oils it has antimicrobial properties too Now the notsogood thing Out of the 95 compounds the major ones are citronellol and geraniol fragrant components that might irritate sensitive skin
737,Rosa Damascena Flower Water,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/rosa-damascena-flower-water,"The flower water coming from the flowers of the Damask Rose In general flower waters also called hydrosols are diluted versions of essential oils coming from the same plant They contain the same components but in muchreduced concentrations
Similar to its big sister rose oil rose water also has a lovely relaxing scent It contains some antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds as well as some fragrant components If your skin is super sensitive it is a good idea to choose products without fragrant floral waters"
738,Rosa Rubiginosa Seed Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/rosa-rubiginosa-seed-oil,The oil coming from the seeds of the wild rose bush most common in the southern Andes in Chile btw Rosa Rubiginosa Rosa Eglanteria and Rosa Mosqueta all refer to the same oil however the more commonly used Rosa Canina is a bit different Similar to many other great plant oils it is a nice nourishing and moisturizing oil loaded with fatty acids linoleic acid 44 linolenic acid 34 and oleic acid 14 What makes rosehip oil a special snowflake among all the plant oils out there is that it also contains the miracle active transretinoic acid aka tretinoin It is the main bioactive component of the oil and has all kinds of magic abilities including restoring and regenerating tissues the oil is great for scars and burns decreasing wrinkles helping acne and even normalizing pore size Just one more note a study found that the tretinoin content of rosehip seed oil greatly depends on the extraction method The oil coming from cold pressing contained seven times more tretinoin 0357 mll than the oil from organic solvent extraction Always go for the coldpressed version
739,Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/rosmarinus-officinalis-leaf-extract,The extract coming from the lovely herb rosemary It contains lots of chemicals including flavonoids phenolic acids and diterpenes Its main active is rosmarinic acid a potent antioxidant and antiinflammatory It has also antibacterial astringent and toning properties The leaves contain a small amount of essential oil 12 with fragrant components so if you are allergic to fragrance it might be better to avoid it

746,Rutin,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/rutin,"Rutin is a polyphenol flavonoid found in many plants for example citrus fruits The main reason its used in cosmetics is its high antioxidant and free radicalscavenging ability similar to that of superstar ascorbic acid but also has some antibacterial nature and woundhealing properties
There is also an invitro made in Petri dishes on animal cell lines study showing potential for rutin as a skinwhitening agent and people have even tried using it to increase the UVblocking ability of SPF agents but with inconsistent results Either way its antioxidant abilities should still help protect the skin against sun damage from the UV light that isn’t blocked by SPF agents"

749,SH-Oligopeptide-1,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sh-oligopeptide-1,"ShOligopeptide1 is the famous molecule which is also called Epidermal Growth Factor or EGF Chemically speaking Growth Factors are largish peptides or smallish proteins or to put it in another way mediumlength amino acid sequences EGF consists of 53 amino acids Biologically speaking Growth Factors are cellular signal molecules that can stimulate cell growth proliferation healing andor differentiation There are lots of Growth Factors and EGF is just one of them The topic of Growth Factors and skincare is a big confusing and controversial one and we will try our best to summarize the story for you including the pros and the cons EGF is a special snowflake when it comes to skincare as it was the first Growth Factor that made its way into cosmetic products and it is also the most common one The American biochemist Stanley Cohen discovered EGF and was awarded a Noble prize in 1986 for it As the Noble prize may signify the molecule is significant and powerful and directly stimulates the proliferation of epidermal cells When it comes to ShOligopeptide1 in a cosmetic product it has pretty wellestablished wound healing and skin renewal properties It might even do more than that According to a 2012 study on a serum containing barley bioengineered epidermal growth factor clinical evaluations showed statistically significant improvement in the appearance of fine lines and rhytids skin texture pore size and various dyschromatic conditions apparent within the first month of use and continuing improvement trends for the duration of the study which was 3 months
This all sounds amazing give me some EGF Serum we can hear you say But as we wrote in the intro the topic is complex and controversial so here are some of the questions that keep coming up around slathering EGF all over our face The first and biggest concern is that if EGF is so good at stimulating cell proliferation how does it relate to cancer Is the definition of cancer not cells proliferating out of control Most experts agree on this answer EGF is mitogenic stimulates cell proliferation but not mutagenic does not alter the cell to make it cancerous If you do not have cancer you will not get cancer from EGF However if you have cancerous cells EGF will help them to spread just like it helps healthy cells So if you have a lot of moles excessive UV exposure in the past or if you have any of the skin cancer risk factors we suggest you should think twice about using EGF products The same is true if you have psoriasis a skin disease related to the abnormal growth of epidermal skin cells You do not want to add fuel to the fire with EGF Other less serious concerns are if EGF can properly penetrate the skin as it is a mediumsized polar molecule so a special delivery system is probably needed if it can affect collagen synthesis or just works on the surface plumping up only the upmost layers of the skin and if it has beneficial effects at all when used in isolation versus when used in a conditioned media that contains lots of growth factors resembling the synergistic balance found in the skin Overall our impression is that EGF is definitely a potent molecule Some EGF products have a cultlike following adding anecdotal evidence to the clinical studies showing EGF has a beneficial effect on the skin If you like experimenting by all means go ahead unless you have psoriasis or high skin cancer risk factors but if you are a better safe than sorry type stick to daily SPF a good retinoid product This duo is still the golden standard of antiaging

762,Salicylic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/salicylic-acid,"Its one of the gold standard ingredients for treating problem skin It can exfoliate skin both on the surface and in the pores Its a potent antiinflammatory agent Its more effective for treating blackheads than acne For acne combine it with antibacterial agents like benzoyl peroxide or azelaic acid If you have ever struggled with let’s just call it “problem skin” you know acne blackheads whiteheads large pores then most probably you are familiar with salicylic acid SA Even if the name does not ring a bell you have probably used it Next to benzoyl peroxide it’s the gold standard ingredient for treating problem skin There are two reasons for this
Reason 1 It can exfoliate skin both on the surface and in the pores
AHAs are very cool but they are water soluble and cannot go into the pores SA is lipid soluble and it can go right into the pores and shed the stuck dead skin cells out from there That’s really good for treating blackheads as well as preventing acne formation This was confirmed also by a study that compared 8 AHA and 2 BHA for treating blackheads AHA did not decrease the blackhead density statistically significantly but BHA did Reason 2 SA is a potent antiinflammatory The chemical structure of SA is very similar to aspirin and it does have similar antiirritant and antiinflammatory effect That is helpful both for acne and rosacea So SA is definitely an ingredient to try if you have oily or problem skin but all in all it’s more effective against blackheads than inflamed zits For the latter one it’s only moderately effective and benzoyl peroxide outperforms it by leaps and bounds But they work in different ways so a combination therapy is a great way to fight and win against acne In fact it’s a good idea to combine SA not only with BP but with any other antibacterial agent such as azelaic acid or mandelic acid
What else to know For at home use 052 SA is effective and these products are usually gentle enough for daily use In fact in the EU 2 is the maximum strength allowed in at home products There are also professional BHA peels that go in the 2030 range Those can fade pigmentation decrease surface roughness reduce fine lines and of course treat acne Regarding pH requirements for BHA unlike for AHAs where an acidic pH is super important for efficacy it might be less relevant for BHA Oh and one more things studies show that SA at 2 does not increase skin’s sun sensitivity but it has photoprotective effects Not that we want to tell you not to use sunscreen because please do
Bottom line SA is a great exfoliant and antiinflammatory and you should definitely try it if you have oily skin large pores blackheads or whiteheads If you have acne it is a useful adjacent treatment combined with an antibacterial agent such as benzoyl peroxide or azelaic acid"

781,Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/simmondsia-chinensis-seed-oil,"Jojoba is a drought resistant evergreen shrub native to Southwestern North America Its known and grown for jojoba oil the golden yellow liquid coming from the seeds about 50 of the weight of the seeds will be oil At first glance it seems like your average emollient plant oil it looks like an oil and its nourishing and moisturizing to the skin but if we dig a bit deeper it turns out that jojoba oil is really special and unique technically or rather chemically its not an oil but a wax ester and calling it an oil is kind of sloppy So what the heck is a wax ester and why is that important anyway Well to understand what a wax ester is you first have to know that oils are chemically triglycerides one glycerin three fatty acids attached to it The fatty acids attached to the glycerin vary and thus we have many kinds of oils but they are all triglycerides Mother Nature created triglycerides to be easily hydrolyzed be broken down to a glycerin 3 fatty acid molecules and oxidized the fatty acid is broken down into small parts this happens basically when we eat fats or oils and our body generates energy from it
Mother Nature also created wax esters but for a totally different purpose Chemically a wax ester is a fatty acid a fatty alcohol one long molecule Wax esters are on the outer surface of several plant leaves to give them environmental protection 2530 of human sebum is also wax esters to give us people environmental protection So being a wax ester results in a couple of unique properties First jojoba oil is extremely stable Like crazy stable Even if you heat it to 370 C 698 F for 96 hours it does not budge Many plant oils tend to go off pretty quickly If you have some pure jojoba oil at home you should be fine using it for years Second jojoba oil is the most similar to human sebum both being wax esters and the two are completely miscible Acneorg has this not fully proven theory that thanks to this jojoba might be able to trick the skin into thinking it has already produced enough sebum so it might have skin balancing properties for oily skin
Third jojoba oil moisturizes the skin through a unique dual action on the one hand it mixes with sebum and forms a thin nongreasy semiocclusive layer on the other hand it absorbs into the skin through pores and hair follicles then diffuses into the intercellular spaces of the outer layer of the skin to make it soft and supple
On balance the point is this in contrast to real plant oils wax esters were designed by Mother Nature to stay on the surface and form a protective moisturizing barrier and jojoba oil being a wax ester is uniquely excellent at doing that"
782,Snail Egg Extract,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/snail-egg-extract,"The extract coming from the eggs of the garden snail or Cornu aspersum When it comes to snails and cosmetics the snail slime is a pretty common ingredient that does have nice repair and hydration properties As for the eggs extract a study from 2015 examined it in vitro in the lab not on real people and found promising skin regenerative properties
More specifically snail eggs extract seem to promote the production of extracellular matrix components fibronectin collagen 1 and MMPs and it also seems to improve the cell survival after UVB irradiation The results from the study are promising but do not forget that its invitro so it may or may not apply when we slather snail eggs extract on our face"
783,Snail Secretion Filtrate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/snail-secretion-filtrate,"If you are into the KBeauty trend you must have bumped into snail slime like a thousand times Korean brands love the ingredient and tout it for its miraculous repair and hydration properties Its claimed to be able to repair everything from dry patches acne breakouts to signs of aging and we are happy to say that it might be just true
So snail slime is the yucky stuff that snails in cosmetics the secretion of Cornu Aspersum the garden snail is used produce when they are in stress its not the same as the one they secret to be able to move nicely and smoothly As the cosmetic chemists at the Beauty Brains blog write chemically speaking snail slime is a complex mixture of proteoglycans glycosaminoglycans glycoprotein enzymes hyaluronic acid copper peptides antimicrobial peptides and trace elements including copper zinc and iron English translation equals its loaded with a bunch of goodfortheskin stuff
As for scientific proof that snail slime does something for the skin we did find a couple of studies to go by A Spanish radiation oncologist Rafael Abad Iglesias MD discovered for the first time that snail mucin can be used to treat radiation dermatitis skin irritation caused by radiotherapy a form of cancer treatment He did a clinical study with 100 patients and reported a statistically significant clinical improvement in erythema itching and burning pain in the group treated with snail slime A 2007 study examined the molecular basis for the great regeneration properties of the ingredient It found that snail slime SS indeed does a bunch of positive things that could be the reason for its great repair abilities First it has serious antioxidant properties thanks to two great antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione stransferase Second SS induces fibroblast proliferation thats particularly important during wound healing Third SS was also found to downregulate MMP an evil enzyme thats out there to destroy skinfirming collagen These properties add up to give SS not only wound healing and regenerative properties but also serious antiaging potential Regarding antiaging a 2013 study in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology examined the effect of SS on photoaged skin The 14week doubleblind 25 participant study found that there was a significant degree of improvement in fines lines though the participants did not report a significant difference in the quality of their skin
All in all we think that snail slime definitely deserves the skin goodie status it already enjoys in the Kbeauty space If you have no problem with somewhat strange yucky things or animal derived ingredients in your products its worth a try"
784,Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-acetylated-hyaluronate,Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate is a variation of current IT moisturizer Hyaluronic acid where some waterloving OH groups are replaced by amphipathic partly waterloving and partly waterhating acetyl groups The modified molecule is claimed to have even better moisture retention ability than normal HA and better affinity to the skin surface The better affinity comes from the acetyl groups that act as tiny anchors to attach the HA molecule to the skin Staying on top of the skin better and longer means longerlasting surface hydration and improved elasticity It is also less sticky and more cosmetically elegant than normal HA so no wonder the nickname of this molecule is super hyaluronic acid
785,Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-acrylate-sodium-acryloyldimethyl-taurate-copolymer,"A copolymer is a big molecule that consists not of one but of two repeating subunits This particular copolymer is a handy helper ingredient to form nice gel textures

788,Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-ascorbyl-phosphate,"The sodium salt form of skincare superstar vitamin C If you do not know what the big fuss about vitamin C is you are missing out and you have to click here and read all the geeky details about it
Pure vitamin C aka ascorbic acid AA is great and all but its lack of stability is a big challenge for the cosmetics industry One solution is to create stable derivatives that can be absorbed into the skin convert there to AA and do all the magic AA is proven to do which is being an antioxidant a collagen booster and a skin brightener
SAP the vit C derivative not the enterprise software obvs is a promising derivative that has great stability up to pH 7 The challenge with it though is skin penetration Unfortunately it seems to be limited or to quote a great article from the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology topically applied ascorbyl phosphate salts are at very best poorly absorbed in comparison with AA Regarding conversion to AA there seems to be no data about it so we can neither deny nor confirm it
We have better news regarding the three magic abilities of vitamin C there is invivo tested on real people data showing that SAP does have photoprotective aka antioxidant properties though less than pure AA SAP might also aid collagen boosting invitro made in the lab data shows that it works but is less effective than another vitamin C derivative called MAP that seems to be as effective as pure AA As for skinbrightening there is a trade publication with invivo data showing that SAP can fade brown spots Another thing SAP might be able to do is to help with acne A 2005 study showed in vitro in test tubes that 1 SAP has a strong antimicrobial activity on evil acne causing P acnes and it also showed in vivo on real people that 5 SAP can strongly improve the inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions of acne vulgaris In fact the results were comparable or even slightly better than with 5 benzoyl peroxide And there is even more regarding SAP and acne A nice doubleblind study from 2009 showed that 5 SAP reduced the inflammatory lesions by 2014 and 4882 within 4 and 8 weeks respectively and when combined with 02 retinol the results were even better With this combination treatment the improvement was 2928 after 4 weeks and 6310 after 8 weeks of application Aside from research studies anecdotal evidence also supports SAP being a promising vitamin C derivative One of the bestselling vitamin C serums in Sephora is the Ole Henriksen Truth Serum while on Amazon its the OzNaturals Vitamin C 20 Serum Another popular choice is the Mad Hippie Vitamin C serum and all of these contain vitamin C in the form of SAP Overall we think SAP is a goody In terms of antiaging its probably not as effective as pure Ascorbic Acid but its totally worth a try However if your skin is acneprone SAP is your form of Vitamin C and its a musttry"
789,Sodium Benzoate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-benzoate,A helper ingredient that helps to make the products stay nice longer aka preservative It works mainly against fungi It’s pH dependent and works best at acidic pH levels 35 It’s not strong enough to be used in itself so it’s always combined with something else often with potassium sorbate
790,Sodium Borate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-borate,A very alkaline colorless crystalline powder used in tiny amounts to set the pH of cosmetics products to be just right In larger amounts it can be a skin irritant the Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel concluded that sodium borate up to 5 is safe as a cosmetic ingredient though a 5 solution should not be used on infant or injured skin

792,Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate,A versatile and biodegradable cleansing agent with high cleaning power and strong foaming properties Unfortunately these two properties for a surfactant usually mean that it is harsh on the skin which is the case here as well
793,Sodium Carbomer,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-carbomer,A preneutralised form of super common thickener Carbomer This means that it forms viscous gels immediately upon addition to water while Carbomer has to be neutralized with a base but it can also be harder to disperse evenly in the formula
794,Sodium Chloride,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-chloride,"Sodium chloride is the fancy name of salt Normal everyday table salt If similar to us you are in the weird habit of reading the label on your shower gel while taking a shower you might have noticed that sodium chloride is almost always on the ingredient list The reason for this is that salt acts as a fantastic thickener in cleansing formulas created with ionic cleansing agents aka surfactants such as Sodium Laureth Sulfate A couple of percents typically 13 turns a runny surfactant solution into a nice gel texture
If you are into chemistry if not we understand just skip this paragraph the reason is that electrolytes you know the Na and Cl ions screen the electrostatic repulsion between the head groups of ionic surfactants and thus support the formation of long shaped micelles instead of spherical ones that entangle like spaghetti and viola a gel is formed However too much of it causes the phenomenon called salting out and the surfactant solution goes runny again Other than that salt also works as an emulsion stabilizer in waterinoil emulsions that is when water droplets are dispersed in the outer oil or silicone phase And last but not least when salt is right at the first spot of the ingredient list and is not dissolved the product is usually a body scrub where salt is the physical exfoliating agent"
795,Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-chondroitin-sulfate,Though its name does not reveal it this molecule is a relative of famous ITmoisturizer Hyaluronic Acid Just like HA it is a glycosaminoglycan aka GAG meaning that it is a big sugar molecule from repeated subunits whats more one of the subunits is the same glucuronic acid Along with HA and other GAGs it likes to hang out in the dermis middle layer of the skin where it is part of the gooey bouncy stuff outside of the cells called extracellular matrix ECM As for skincare Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate is probably too big to go right into the dermis though much smaller than HA with 500050 000 Da molecular weight but it has a comparable water binding ability to HA which means a crazy water binding ability and better affinity for the skin surface This means that it forms a nice waterrich film on the skin bringing an immediate and strong moisturising effect
796,Sodium Citrate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-citrate,A little helper ingredient that is used to adjust the pH of the product It also helps to keep products stay nice longer by neutralizing the metal ions in the formula they usually come from water
797,Sodium Cocoamphoacetate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-cocoamphoacetate,A clear yellowish liquid that works as a cleansing agent It has socalled amphoteric structure meaning that its head contains both a positively and a negatively charged part surfactants are most commonly anionic meaning their head has a negative charge Its structure makes Sodium Cocoamphoacetate very mild with great foaming properties Its popular in baby products
798,Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-glutamate,A vegetable based cosurfactant that helps to create mild cleansing formulas
799,Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate,A cleansing agent thats claimed to be so gentle on the skin that it hardly impacts the skin barrier It also gives a rich creamy foam its based on vegetable fatty acids and is readily biodegradableIts an especially important and popular ingredient in syndet bars or soapless soaps Dr Leslie Baumann says in her great Cosmetic Dermatology book that thanks to the unique molecular characteristic of Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate it has defined a new dimension in the mildness of cleansing bars
800,Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-sarcosinate,A mild and gentle cleansing agent derived from the amino acid sarcosine and coconut fatty acids It is known for its good foam boosting abilities and improving the mildness of the formula

802,Sodium Gluconate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-gluconate,The neutralized form of gluconic acid Its a great ingredient to neutralize metal especially iron and copper ions in a cosmetic product This helps to prevent discoloration of the formula over time or rancidity of cosmetic oils It can also be a pH regulator and a humectant helps skin to cling onto waterIts also used in oral care products where it reduces the bitterness of other ingredients And its natural both Ecocert and Cosmos approved source manufacturer info
803,Sodium Hyaluronate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate,"It’s the sodium form cousin of the famous NMF hyaluronic acid HA If HA does not tell you anything we have a super detailed geeky explanation about it here The TL DR version of HA is that its a huge polymer big molecule from repeated subunits found in the skin that acts as a sponge helping the skin to hold onto water being plump and elastic HA is famous for its crazy water holding capacity as it can bind up to 1000 times its own weight in water
As far as skincare goes sodium hyaluronate and hyaluronic acid are pretty much the same and the two names are used interchangeably As cosmetic chemist kindofstephen writes on reddit sodium hyaluronate disassociates into hyaluronic acid molecule and a sodium atom in solution In spite of this if you search for hyaluronic acid vs sodium hyaluronate you will find on multiple places that sodium hyaluronate is smaller and can penetrate the skin better Chemically this is definitely not true as the two forms are almost the same both are polymers and the subunits can be repeated in both forms as much as you like We also checked Prospector for sodium hyaluronate versions actually used in cosmetic products and found that the most common molecular weight was 1518 million Da that absolutely counts as high molecular weight
What seems to be a true difference though is that the salt form is more stable easier to formulate and cheaper so it pops up more often on the ingredient lists If you wanna become a real HAandtheskin expert you can read way more about the topic at hyaluronic acid including penetrationquestions differences between high and low molecular weight versions and a bunch of references to scientific literature"
804,Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate-crosspolymer,"Its a special crosslinked from of ITmoisturizer hyaluronic acid HA Crosslinked means that normal HA pieces 12 million Da molecular weight are chemically bound togeather to create a big infinite mesh
The special HA mesh has a remarkable waterbinding capacity 5 times more than the already crazy waterbinding capacity of normal HA This water filled crosslinked HA gel forms a smooth film on the skin and continuously delivers the bound water so it gives longterm moisturizing benefits
Btw crosslinking HA was developed for dermal fillers as crosslinking helps their longevity and this guy is the topical version of FDA approved dermal filler called Hylan B gel Smearing crosslinked version all over ourselves is a newish thing and incoming evidence so far suggests that its a great idea even better than normal HA A very recent 2016 research article compared the topical moisturizing effect of crosslinked HA not Hylan B gel specifically but something called Resilient HA or RHA HMWHA and LMWHA and found that TEWL that is transepidermal water loss the water that evaporates from the skin was reduced by 278 with RHA and by 156 with HMW HA but increased by 555 with LMW HA You can read much more about HMW and LMW HA here in the geeky details section
All in all we think Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer is an awesome version of HA probably superior to traditional versions so be happy to spot it on the ingredient list"
805,Sodium Hydroxide,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-hydroxide,The unfancy name for it is lye It’s a solid white stuff that’s very alkaline and used in small amounts to adjust the pH of the product and make it just right For example in case of AHA or BHA exfoliants the right pH is superduper important and pH adjusters like sodium hydroxide are needed BTW lye is not something new It was already used by ancient Egyptians to help oil and fat magically turn into something else Can you guess what Yes it’s soap It still often shows up in the ingredient list of soaps and other cleansersSodium hydroxide in itself is a potent skin irritant but once its reacted as it is usually in skin care products like exfoliants it is totally harmless
806,Sodium Lactate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-lactate,The sodium salt of lactic acid Its a great skin moisturizer and also used to regulate the pH value of the cosmetic formula Its a natural ingredient approved by both ECOCERT and COSMOS
807,Sodium Laureth Sulfate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate,It’s probably the most common cleansing ingredient of all It’s usually the Chief Bubble Officer responsible for big bubbles in cleansing products through the foam it creates is a bit airy and loose and not as dense and luxurious as the foam created by infamous SLS As for mildness it goes somewhere in the middle It’s often confused with sodium lauryl sulfate SLS but they are absolutely not the same The SLES molecule has a bigger watersoluble head part that makes it milder and much less irritating It is considered absolutely ok in the amount used in cosmetic products though if you are looking for a mild facial cleanser you have better chances with a formula without SLES For an average shower gel SLES works just fine
808,Sodium Lauroamphoacetate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/sodium-lauroamphoacetate,A mild amphoteric contains both a negative and a positive ion in its waterloving head part surfactant that gives a nice foam and also has the unique ability to reduce irritation from other cosurfactants

You have probably read the terms free radicals and antioxidants a thousand times and you know that free radicals are the evil guys and antioxidants are the good guys So superoxide radical is a very common free radical that can cause all kinds of cell damages and superoxide dismutase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of superoxide radicals into molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide btw this one has to be further converted by other antioxidant enzymes called catalases
The extra nice thing about SOD is that it remains intact during the neutralization process and can continue its magic while nonenzymatic antioxidants like vitamin E are used up during neutralization
The efficacy studies of topical SOD are promising Invitro made in the lab tests show that SOD is a more effective antioxidant than vitamin E green tea extract and MAP There is also an invivo made on real people study that measured how SOD can reduce the redness caused by UV rays and it was much more effective than vitamin E pure or acetate form and ascorbyl palmitate All in all SOD is a really potent antioxidant and slathering it all over yourself is a great way to give the skin a little extra help in protecting itself from all the bad environmental things out there"

But do not panic most probably your skincare product does not contain anywhere near that dose For example a German sportointment to treat ankle sprains contains only 035 μgg PA so even with four uses per day the dose is way below 10 μgg The same is probably true for your skincare product"

873,Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/tetrahexyldecyl-ascorbate,"Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate is a stable oilsoluble form of skincare big shot Vitamin C If you do not know why Vitamin C is such a big deal in skincare click here and read all about it We are massive vitamin C fans and have written about it in excruciating detail
So now you know that Vitamin C is great and all but its really unstable and gives cosmetics companies many headaches To solve this problem they came up with vitamin C derivatives and one of them is Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate lets call it ATIP in short
Its a really promising candidate see below but while reading all the goodness about it in a minute do not forget that derivatives not only have to be absorbed into the skin but also have to be converted to pure vitamin C ascorbic acid or AA and the efficacy of the conversion is often unknown In addition vitamin Cs three magic properties antioxidant collagen booster skin brightener are all properly proven invivo on real people but for the derivatives its mostly invitro studies or in the case of ATIP its invitro and done by an ingredient supplier
With this context in mind lets see what ATIP might be able to do First it is stable if pH 5 easy to formulate and a joy to work with for a cosmetic chemist
Second because its oilsoluble its skin penetration abilities seem to be great So great in fact that it surpasses the penetration of pure vitamin C threefold at the same concentration and it penetrates successfully into the deeper layers of the skin that is usually important to do some antiaging work There is also invitro data showing that it converts to AA in the skin Third ATIP seems to have all three magic abilities of pure vitamin C it gives antioxidant protection from both UVB and UVA rays it increases collagen synthesis even more than AA and it has a skin brightening effect by reducing melanogenesis by more than 80 in human melanoma cell cultures
So this all sounds really great but these are only invitro results at this point We could find Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate mentioned only in one published invivo study that examined the antiaging properties of a silicone formula containing 10 AA and 7 ATIP The authors theorized that the 10 AA is released slowly from the silicon delivery system and probably stays in the upper layer of the skin to give antioxidant benefits while ATIP penetrates more rapidly and deeply and gives some wrinklereducing benefits The study was a small 10 patients doubleblind experiment and the formula did show some measurable antiaging results However it is hard to know how much pure vitamin C or ATIP can be thanked
Bottom line a really promising but not wellproven vitamin C derivative that can be worth a try especially if you like experimenting but if you like the tried and true pure vitamin C will be your best bet"

883,Theobroma Cacao Seed Butter,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/theobroma-cacao-seed-butter,Theobroma means food of the gods in Greek though probably treat of the people would be more spot on The cacao fruits and especially the seeds in it need no introduction as everyone knows them as the magical raw material of the magical sweet treat chocolate the flavour is composed of more than 1200 substances and the exact chemical nature of it is not really understood so its indeed magic As for skincare cocoa butter counts as a rich emollient that can moisturize and nourish even the driest skin think chapped hands or lips Its solid at room temperature and melts nicely when you smear it on Its loaded with goodfortheskin things it contains fatty acids mainly oleic 35 stearic 34 and palmitic 25 and it also has antioxidant vitamin E and polyphenolsAn exvivo made on human skin but not on real people study examined the cocoa polyphenols and found that 05075 of them improved skin tone and elasticity and had a similarly positive impact on GAGs important natural moisturizing factors in the skin and collagen synthesis than a commercial highend moisturizer it was an Estee Lauder oneAll in all cocoa butter is a goodie especially for very dry skin
884,Thioctic Acid,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/thioctic-acid,AlphaLipoic Acid ALA is a great antioxidant thats also part of the bodys natural antioxidant system Its soluble both in waterrich and lipidrich environments so its versatile and can interact with many types of evil oxidants as well as other nice antioxidants ALA seems to be a great choice for topical use as studies show it can penetrate the skin rapidly where its converted to DHLA dihydrolipoic acid an even more potent antioxidant molecule A nicely designed we mean doubleblind placebocontrolled 12week study from 2003 confirmed that 5 ALA cream can decrease skin roughness and improve general signs of photoaging statistically significantly A slight catch though is that burning and warmth in the skin was quite a common side effect especially in the first 4 weeks All in all ALA is definitely a researchproven great antioxidant but if your skin is sensitive higher concentrations might not be for you
885,Threonine,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/threonine,An essential amino acid thats also a key building block of collagen and elastin When taken orally it helps the digestive and intestinal tracts function more smoothly and also helps the absorption of nutrients As for skincare it is not clear what it does other than being a skin hydrator

887,Tin Oxide,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/tin-oxide,"Far from the tin cans you find in the supermarket Tin Oxide is mostly used when dealing with socalled effect pigments tricky composite pigments that can do color travel change color depending on the viewing angle or give multiple color effect Its often found alongside Mica as a base material and Titanium Dioxide as a coating to give a glossy pearlescent effect Together they make up a trademarked technology called RonaFlair Blanace from the German manufacturer Merck According to their info this combination can balance out undesirable tones in the skin making it a popular choice for brightening products and highlighters
Other than that CosIng the official EU INCI database lists its uses as being a bulking agent to increase the volume of products as well as a physical exfoliant or an opacifying agent but being part of composite effect pigments is a much more common use case"
888,Titanium Dioxide,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/titanium-dioxide,"Titanium Dioxide is one of the two members of the elite sunscreen group called physical sunscreens or inorganic sunscreens if you’re a science geek and want to be precise
Traditionally UVfilters are categorized as either chemical or physical The big difference is supposed to be that chemical agents absorb UVlight while physical agents reflect it like a bunch of mini umbrellas on top of the skin While this categorization is easy and logical it turns out its not true A recent 2016 study shows that inorganic sunscreens work mostly by absorption just like chemical filters and only a little bit by reflection they do reflect the light in the visible spectrum but mostly absorb in the UV spectrum
Anyway it doesnt matter if it reflects or absorbs Titanium Dioxide is a pretty awesome sunscreen agent for two main reasons it gives a nice broad spectrum coverage and its highly stable Its protection is very good between 290 350 nm UVB and UVA II range and less good at 350400 nm UVA I range Regular sized Titanium Dioxide also has a great safety profile its nonirritating and is pretty much free from any health concerns like estrogenic effect worries with some chemical filters
The disadvantage of Titanium Dioxide is that its not cosmetically elegant meaning its a white unspreadable mess Sunscreens containing Titanium Dioxide are often hard to spread on the skin and they leave a disturbing whitish tint The cosmetic industry is of course really trying to solve this problem and the best solution so far is using nanoparticles The itsybitsy Nanosized particles improve both spreadability and reduce the whitish tint a lot but unfortunately it also introduces new health concerns The main concern with nanoparticles is that they are so tiny that they are absorbed into the skin more than we want them ideally sunscreen should remain on the surface of the skin Once absorbed they might form unwanted complexes with proteins and they might promote the formation of evil free radicals But do not panic these are concerns under investigation A 2009 review article about the safety of nanoparticles summarizes this to date invivo and invitro studies have not demonstrated percutaneous penetration of nanosized particles in titanium dioxide and zinc oxide sunscreens The English translation is so far it looks like sunscreens with nanoparticles do stay on the surface of the skin where they should be All in all Titanium Dioxide is a famous sunscreen agent and for good reason it gives broad spectrum UV protection best at UVB and UVA II its highly stable and it has a good safety profile Its definitely one of the best UVfilter agents we have today especially in the US where newgeneration Tinosorb filters are not yet approved"
889,Tocopherol,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/tocopherol,"Primary fatsoluble antioxidant in our skin Significant photoprotection against UVB rays Vit C Vit E work in synergy and provide great photoprotection Has emollient properties Easy to formulate stable and relatively inexpensive Vitamin E is the major fatsoluble antioxidant in our skin As a strong antioxidant it’s an Aplayer in protecting the skin cells from the nasty little things called freeradicals that want to destroy the lovely collagen that makes our skin nice and firm Because it’s fat soluble our skin just loves to absorb it as opposed to water soluble things where we have to trick our skin to absorb them
Vit E can be found in many foods vegetables oils seeds nuts corn soy whole wheat flour margarine and even some meats and dairy products The natural form is denoted by a ‘d’ in the beginning of the name and ‘dl’ denotes the synthetic form While this is absolutely not always true in this case research shows that the natural form is more active and is better absorbed The name tocopherol actually refers to a whole group of stuff and it has four subtypes alpha beta gamma and delta The subtypes are quite different alphatocopherol is the nicest and most active one while deltatocopherol seems to be the lazy guy and does not even have antioxidant properties In cosmetic products mixed tocopherol containing all subtypes or alphatocopherol is the best choice There are lots of studies showing that Vit E has some nice photoprotection properties meaning it can protect the skin from UV and in case of Vit E it’s mainly UVB rays If you put it on your skin it lowers the production of sunburn cells reduces the damage caused by UVB rays and inhibits photocarcinogenesis What it does not do is helping agains UVA caused skin issues like sagging But if you combine it with Vit C especially in high amount like 15 the two together work in synergy give broad spectrum protection and double each others effectiveness There is also this urban legend that Vit E helps in wound healing Well that just seems to be a legend Several studies were made to prove this point but so far none of them managed to do so In some cases it made things even worse So if you have some surgical scars do not put Vit E containing stuff on it It’s an urban legend no proof"
890,Tocopheryl Acetate,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate,It’s the most commonly used version of pure vitamin E in cosmetics You can read all about the pure form here This one is the socalled esterified version According to famous dermatologist Leslie Baumann while tocopheryl acetate is more stable and has a longer shelf life it’s also more poorly absorbed by the skin and may not have the same awesome photoprotective effects as pure Vit E

So Tremella Extract is a big molecule more than 1M Da molecular weight with sugar constituents of Mannose Xylose and Glucuronic acid 20 The last one is the most important one as Glucuronic acid is also a major component in hyaluronic acid HA Thanks to this Tremella is claimed to be an awesome moisturizer with slightly greater waterholding capacities than HA itself This is quite a big deal as HA is known for its crazy waterholding capacity up to 1000 times its own weight
Not only that but Tremella also seems to have some antioxidant effect its not sticky humectants do tend to be sticky and it leaves skin moist and smooth No wonder Concubine Yang Kueifei liked this mushroom"
894,Tretinoin,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/tretinoin,"Tretinoin a metabolite of vitamin A is the gold standard antiaging ingredient that is also FDAapproved and its the only one so far Its an all around skin issue fixer as it works at the skin cell level and makes your skin cells behave in a healthy and normal way It makes the skin less wrinkled firmer smoother and tighter everything you could want from an antiaging ingredient Its also an effective acne treatment It normalizes keratinization and makes the pores produce less sebum Its also a skin lightener though not as effective as goldstandard hydroquinone Side effects with tretinoin are very common Irritation skin flaking redness and drier skin are usual Do not use tretinoin or any form of retinoids while pregnant To minimize side effects introduce tretinoin slowly into your routine see more how to use tips in geeky details If you wanna get the best possible antiaging and a bunch of other effects from your skincare products tretinoin or one of the other form of retinoids has to be in your skincare routine Tretinoin works Its proven and its the gold standard in antiaging technology Its the real deal
Before we dive deep into this topic lets just clear up some vocab the word retinoids refers to a group of compounds that are all derived from vitamin A Retinoids include betacarotene the thing in orange vegetables like carrot or sweet potato retinol pure vitamin A itself and tretinoin There are a few other forms but lets not get caught up in the details too much Retinoic acid is a kind of synonym for tretinoin or to be exact alltransretinoicacids are exactly the same as tretinoin FYI tretinoin is a naturally occurring thing and can be found in good quality rosehip oil
A little history Retinoids are not something new and the intense research into them started quite a while ago In 1931 Paul Karrer won the Nobel prize for figuring out the structure of vitamin A Twelve years later retinol was successfully synthesized and since then vitamin A derivatives started to pop up
Tretinoin itself was developed in the late 1960s by two guys named James Fulton and Albert Kligman It was originally intended to treat acne but acne patients in the clinical trials started to report smoother and less wrinkled skin so the research into its antiaging benefits soon began It went so well that the data was submitted to the FDA the authority that approves drugs in the US and it approved tretinoin for use against photo damage Even today tretinoin is the only thing approved by the FDA in the topical antiaging field so its a really big deal
Allaround magic for skin health Dr Leslie Baumann writes in her great Cosmetic Dermatology book that there are more than 125 distinct dermatologic disorders for which there is credible evidence of retinoid efficacy Dont worry we will not list out all of them but if you have one or more of the common skin problems like wrinkles loss of firmness dull skin acne or hyperpigmentation retinoids will improve this
The reason why retinoids especially tretinoin are such an allaround skin problem solver is that they work on the skin at a cellular level and they make your skin cells behave in a healthy and normal way Our skin cells contain retinoic acid receptors and tretinoin binds directly to these receptors and changes basic cell behaviour like gene expression
Antiaging effects in more details When it comes to skin aging collagen plays a big role It acts like tent poles that make sure the tent fabric is nice and firm Adding collagen to the skin from your serumsmoisturizers does not work though Its like throwing poles at a ramshackle tent on the ground and hoping that the poles will magically fall into the right place and erect the tent it simply does not work that way You can do two other things one is to preserve the existing collagen in your skin as much as possible and the other is to convince the skin to create some more The former will prevent wrinkles and loss of firmness the latter has a chance to repair some of the existing damage Tretinoin is great because it works in both ways It inhibits collagendestroying enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases MMPs that are increased by UVB and its also proven to boost the skins own collagen synthesis If that wasnt enough tretinoin also helps aging skin in a bunch of other ways it stimulates not only collagen type I and III but other important skin elements as well eg natural moisturizing factor glycosaminoglycans GAGs or the skin protein filaggrin It also makes the epidermis thicker and compacts the outermost layer of the skin the stratum corneum The net result of all the things tretinoin does is less wrinkled firmer smoother and tighter skin Simply put pretty much everything you could want from an antiaging ingredient Other things tretinoin can help with We have already written that tretinoin was originally developed to treat acne and it does It normalizes keratinization meaning that it prevents dead skin cells from sticking together and clogging the pores Not only that but it also makes your pores produce less sebum that helps the pores to stay nice and clean and not get clogged up by an excess sebum and dead skin cells Another notable benefit of tretinoin is skin lightening It works by both preventing clumping of melanin in basal cells skin cells at the bottom of the epidermis and by accelerating epidermal turnover and so the loss of melanin However the skin lightening effect is not as strong as the goldstandard hydroquinone In TriLuma cream a prescription treatment for melasma tretinoin hydroquinone and a mild steroid are all combined to achieve clinical results
Whats the catch aka side effects We often wonder why medicines just like life work in such a tricky way that the bigger positive effects almost always come with bigger negative side effects This is definitely true for tretinoin and younger looking skin does not come without side effects The most common ones are irritation skin flaking and redness As tretinoin and retinoids in general boosts the proliferation of skin cells the excess stars to visibly flake This usually happens about 24 days after starting a tret treatment and its kind of normal If you want fewer side effects its good to know that more is not always better with tretinoin A study in 1995 compared 01 and 0025 tretinoin creams and found that the improvement of photoaging was similar but the irritation was much bigger with the 01 version Another common side effect is dry or drier skin It seems that tretinoin increases the amount of water that evaporates from the upper layer of the skin this is called Trans Epidermal Water Loss and might also decrease ceramide synthesis at least in the short term Using a good moisturizer next to a tret treatment is a wise move You also have to know that you should not use tretinoin and retinoids in general when you are pregnant If you are taking Accutane or the EU version Roaccutane make 100 sure not to get pregnant whilst on these treatments If you do not take it in the form of medicine but just slather it on your face the teratogenic effect is less established Whats more there is a study from 1993 concluding that topical tretinoin is not associated with an increased risk for major congenital disorders But when it comes to pregnancy we say it’s best to be overcautious and do not use any retinoids in any shape or form
How to use If you are still with us thank you and the possible side effects have not scared you off here are a couple of tips about starting a tretinoin treatment so that you can minimize the side effects and maximize your skins happiness Always use retinoid products in the evening Not because they are photosensitizing but because retinoids tend to have poor stability when exposed to UV light
Do not use too much a pea size amount of product is more than enough In the beginning you can dilute it with an equal amount of moisturizer
If your skin is on the sensitive side wait 15 mins after washing your face or after putting anything else on the skin so that your skin is totally dry which also helps to reduce irritation
Introduce tretinoin treatment in your life gradually start every third night for the first 2 weeks If everything is good we mean no visible irritation increase to every other night for another 2 weeks If everything is still good you can try every night Be extra gentle with your skin in every other way be careful with acids wait 30 minutes between treatments or use in the morning or on separate nights do not use harsh scrubs or microdermabrasion we think its a wise move anyway and do not wax your face Bottom line If your main skin concern is antiaging and you like to use the tried and true solution your best bet is a tretinoin or another retinoid treatment Be careful with it though watch for side effects find the right strength for your skins level of tolerance and your skin will thank you"

898,Triethanolamine,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/triethanolamine,"It’s a little helper ingredient that helps to set the pH of a cosmetic formulation to be just right It’s very alkaline you know the opposite of being very acidic a 1 solution has a pH of around 10
It does not have the very best safety reputation but in general you do not have to worry about it What is true is that if a product contains socalled Nnitrogenating agents eg preservatives like 2Bromo2Nitropropane13Diol 5Bromo5Nitro 13Dioxane or sodium nitrate so look out for things with nitro nitra in the name that together with TEA can form some not nice carcinogenic stuff that is called nitrosamines But with proper formulation that does not happen TEA in itself is not a bad guy But let’s assume a bad combination of ingredients were used and the nitrosamines formed Even in that case you are probably fine because as far as we know it cannot penetrate the skin But to be on the safe side if you see Triethanolamine in an INCI and also something with nitra nitro in the name of it just skip the product that cannot hurt"
899,Triethoxycaprylylsilane,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/triethoxycaprylylsilane,A clear light yellow liquid that is used to coat pigments such as inorganic sunscreen agents or colorants in cosmetic products The coating helps to stabilize pigments in the formulas and also helps them to spread easily and evenly on the skin

906,Tripeptide-1,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/tripeptide-1,"A small three amino acid glycinehistidinelysine or GHK peptide that is famous for being a type I collagen fragment The theory behind collagenfragment peptides is that when collagen naturally breaks down in the skin the resulting peptide fragments signal to the skin that it should get to work and create some nice new collagen
Adding in collagen fragment peptides like GHK might trick the skin into thinking that collagen has broken down and its time to create some more So Tripeptide1 is believed to be able to stimulate collagen production in the skin and more collagen means fewer wrinkles and younger looking skin FYI Tripeptide1 is the same peptide that can be found in the famous Matrixyl 3000 but in Matrixyl a palmitic acid is attached to it to increase its oil solubility and thus skin penetration
Another reason why Tripeptide1 is especially famous is that it is not only a signal peptide but also a socalled carrier peptide that helps to stabilize and deliver copper in the skin It has a high affinity for copper ions and likes to form a complex with them called CopperTripeptide1 or GHKCu GHKCu is a famous and wellresearched peptide that does a bunch of things in the skin and we have a shiny explanation about it here As for Tripeptide1 in and of itself without a palmitic acid or copper attached to it it goes by the trade name Kollaren and according to the manufacturer it not only stimulates collagen but also other essential skin proteins such as fibronectin elastin and laminin Kollaren is also claimed to be beneficial for acneprone skin as it can boost tissue repair and thus help acne scars to heal faster"
907,Tripeptide-29,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/tripeptide-29,A small threeamino acid peptide GlycineProlineHydroxyproline found naturally in our collagen structureThe theory behind Tripeptide29 is the following Collagen is a long sequence of amino acids and breaking it down produces short amino acid sequences aka peptides These peptides signal to the skin that collagen was lost and that new collagen should be produced So putting collagenfragmentidentical peptides on the skin might trick it into thinking that new collagen is needed The unique thing about Tripeptide29 is that it is not produced by traditional methods such as chemically chopping up collagen as it gives lots of random peptides but it is produced via modern peptide synthesis from nonanimal and nonGMO sources that gives it exceptional purity So Tripeptide29 is available as a pure powder unlike most peptides that are available as diluted solutions which makes it possible to use it in much higher concentrations This sounds great but there is a catch the efficacy data from the manufacturer contains only two tests both invitro aka done in test tubes not on real people Based on the lab test 3 Tripeptide29 can increase collagen type I synthesis by 400 after 48 hours However if anything happens when Tripeptide29 is applied on real human skin is a good question with no answer at least we could not find one Overall the theory is nice but the proof is missing If you are into peptides and experimenting this sure sounds interesting but if you like the tried and true this one is not for you
908,Tris-Biphenyl Triazine,https://incidecoder.com//ingredients/tris-biphenyl-triazine,The newest addition to the Tinosorb sunscreen family a new generation of sunscreen filters that are not available in the US only in other parts of the world This one is so new that its EU only at the moment as of 2016 The unique property of TrisBiphenyl Triazine is that its the most efficient UVB and UVA2 filter known today UVA2 320340 nm is a spot that most filters miss so this guy can help to bridge this common gap and make sunscreen formulas really cover the whole UV spectrum Its also highly photostable and has high SPF performance at low concentrations Though it does not provide protection in the UVA1 340400 nm range it does have a boosting effect there Similar to Trinosorb M it is a hybrid agent between chemical and physical sunscreens and comes in the form of organic micro fine particles

If physical sunscreens dont tell you anything go ahead and read about the basics here Most of what we wrote about Titanium Dioxide is also true for Zinc Oxide so we will focus here on the differences The first main difference is that while TiO2 gives a nice broad spectrum protection Zinc Oxide has an even nicer and even broader spectrum protection It protects against UVB UVA II and UVA I almost uniformly and is considered to be the broadest range sunscreen available today Its also highly stable and nonirritating So much so that Zinc Oxide also counts as a skin protectant and antiirritant Its also often used to treat skin irritations such as diaper rash
As for the disadvantages Zinc Oxide is also not cosmetically elegant It leaves a disturbing whitish tint on the skin although according to a 2000 research paper by Dr Pinnell its slightly less white than TiO2 Still its white and disturbing enough to use Zinc Oxide nanoparticles more and more often We wrote more about nanoparticles and the concerns around them here but the gist is that if nanoparticles were absorbed into the skin that would be a reason for legitimate health concerns But luckily so far research shows that sunscreen nanoparticles are not absorbed but remain on the surface of the skin or in the uppermost dead layer of the skin This seems to be true even if the skin is damaged for example sunburnt All in all if youve found a Zinc Oxide sunscreen that you are happy to use every single day thats fantastic and we suggest you stick with it Its definitely one of the best or probably even the best option out there for sun protection available worldwide"
