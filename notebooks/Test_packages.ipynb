can be huge quality differences between green tea extracts The good ones contain 5090 catechins and often make the product brown and give it a distinctive smell Green tea is proven to be a great antioxidant UV protectant antiinflammatory anticarcinogenic and antimicrobial Because of these awesome properties green tea is a great choice for antiaging and also for skin diseases including rosacea acne and atopic dermatitis We will tell you straight away that we are big green tea fans Drinking it and slathering it all over your face are both great ideas But as this is INCIDecoder and not a findoutwhat’shealthytodrink site we will now just focus on why you should put it on your face\\nOur first reason is that green tea does not only sound good but it’s super well researched According to one of our fav dermatologist dr Leslie Baumann it’s one of the most studied antioxidants A 2015 research summary paper on green tea stated that there are about 6000 research papers on the topic currently in PubMed the US National Library of Medicine research database Before we dive into what the magic powers of green tea are it’s good to know that the most useful components of the tea are called polyphenols and even more precisely catechins There are four major types the most abundant and active one the real superstar is called EGCG EpiGalloCatechin Gallate Also significant ones are ECG EpiCatechin Gallate GCG GalloCatechin Gallate and EGC EpiGallo Catechin but there are also a few more types in green tea To be able to truly judge the efficacy of a green tea product dr Baumann emphasises that it’s important to know the polyphenol content of the extract used There can be huge quality differences between various green tea extracts depending on climate season age of the leaf and how it was grown You know it’s like the tomato that you buy middle of the summer fresh from the market vs the tomato that you buy middle of the winter from a big supermarket and it was picked totally unripe on the other half of the word a while ago they taste totally different According to the 2015 research summary paper an average extract contains only 10 catechins while Dr Todorov of the fantastic smartskincarecom site writes about 25 vs only 4 in black tea Dr Leslie Baumann says in her Cosmetic Dermatology book that a good quality green tea extract should contain 5090 catechins and the highquality ones are brownish and have a characteristic odor So if you stumble upon a green a tea product that’s brown and has a distinct tealike smell that is a great sign of a quality product Ok so now you know that not all green tea extracts are made equal and which ones are the good ones Let’s see those magic powers\\nGreat Antioxidant UV protectant The polyphenols in green tea are strong proven antioxidants That’s good because they help to protect our skin against notsonice little things called free radicals that are out there to destroy the very nice firming collagen in our skin Studies show that green tea reduces UV caused skin irritation and reddening it’s called erythema and decreases the number of sunburn cells It’s a great idea to use a green tea product in the morning under your sunscreen Anticarcinogenic This one partly comes from the antioxidant and UV protectant properties but we wanted to emphasise that green tea does not only give some “superficial” skin benefits but is truly a health protectant It can inhibit DNA damage and even activates some enzymes that help with DNA repair Thanks to this it’s very useful for preventing nonmelanoma type skin cancer So especially if your skin cancer risk factors are high fair skin skin cancer history in the family blue or green eyes past sunburns some types of moles introducing green tea into your skin care is a fantastic thing to do Antiinflammatory Inflammation is an important process that’s a biological protective response to not nice things that happen to our body However too much inflammation in our skin is not good it accelerates the aging process and it’s also behind many skin diseases acne and rosacea the most common examples The catechins in green tea are not only amazing antioxidants but they also possess magic antiinflammatory powers This makes green tea an awesome choice for sensitive rosacea or acne prone skin Antimicrobial This one is probably the least well known but green tea also shows promising antimicrobial properties against some notnice bacteria This property makes green tea even more awesome for acneprone skin We could find two promising research paper results showing that 2 green tea lotion is effective to treat mildtomoderate acne Also atopic dermatitis is a skin diseases that could be improved with the help of the green tea polyphenols So the bottom line is this green tea is a real superstar with magic powers that make it an awesome ingredient to almost everybody If you are worried about antiaging skin cancer prevention acne rosacea or atopic dermatitis it’s an excellent idea to use a highquality green tea product in your skincare routine',\n",

       " 'Its a helper ingredient that improves the freezethaw stability of products Its also a solvent humectant and to some extent a penetration enhancer It has a bad reputation among natural cosmetics advocates but cosmetic scientists and toxicology experts do not agree read more in the geeky details section Propylene Glycol PG is a colorless liquid whose main job usually is to improve the socalled freezethaw stability of the products This means that it makes sure that a product doesn’t freeze or melt in low or high temperatures To achieve this small amounts usually less than 2 is used Other functions of PG include being a humectant helps skin attract water being a solvent for other ingredients and being a penetration enhancer\\nIf you google PG or you like to read around on sites advocating natural cosmetics you might have read some really scary info about this ingredient The two most common accusations are that it’s a strong skin irritant and that it modifies the skin to allow toxins to penetrate it\\nAs for the first one yes PG can be a skin irritant if used 100 on your skin but so can many things in their pure 100 form Think about salt It’s not the same if you try to eat it in itself or if you put a pinch of it on your food So PG used in small amounts in cosmetics is just fine according to every credible scientist and toxicology expert As for the second thing that PG allows toxins to get through our skin it is somewhat true that PG might help some ingredients to penetrate the skin better But it does not work so that a tiny amount of PG allows all the bad stuff to go right into our blood English cosmetic chemist Colin wrote a very good post about this He writes that the skin is very good at keeping things out and getting some good ingredients into it is actually not easy According to his experience PG is not a very good penetration enhancer and fairly large 1025 amount is needed for this function But more than 10 can be irritating so it’s very rare that a cosmetic product contains this large amount The scientists at the Beauty Brains are even more accepting of PG They write that PG is safe for ingestion it can be a food additive AND safe for use in injected drugs so it’s unlikely to cause any problems in a topical cosmetic product applied on intact skin\\nAll in all PG is a helper ingredient and is not especially good for your skin But used in small 5 amounts it’s absolutely fine not poisonous and there is no reason to be afraid of it If you would like to read some more about PG here is the opinion of skin care expert Paula Begoun cosmetic chemists Colin and the Beauty Brains all really good info on the topic',\n",
       " 'The famous or maybe rather infamous mineral oil The clear oily liquid that is the cheap byproduct of refining crude oil and the one that gets a lot of heat for its poor provenance It is a very controversial ingredient with pros and cons and plenty of myths around it So let us see them The pros of mineral oil Trust us if something is used for more than 100 years in cosmetic products it has advantages Chemically speaking cosmetic grade mineral oil is a complex mixture of highly refined saturated hydrocarbons with C1550 chain length It is not merely a byproduct but rather a specifically isolated part of petroleum that is very pure and inert\\nIt is a great emollient and moisturizer working mainly by occlusivity Occlusivity is one of the basic mechanisms of how moisturizers work and it means that mineral oil sits on top of the skin and hinders socalled transepidermal water loss ie water evaporating out of your skin When compared to heavyduty plant oil extra virgin coconut oil the two of them were equally efficient and safe as moisturizers in treating xerosis a skin condition connected to very dry skin\\nThe other thing that mineral oil is really good at is being nonirritating to the skin The chemical composition of plant oils is more complex with many more possible allergens or irritating components while mineral oil is simple pure and sensitivity to it is extremely rare If you check out the classic French pharmacy brands and their moisturizers for the most sensitive allergy prone skin they usually contain mineral oil This is no coincidence The cons of mineral oil The pros of mineral oil can be interpreted as cons if we look at them from another perspective Not penetrating the skin but mostly just sitting on top of it and not containing biologically active components like nice fatty acids and vitamins mean that mineral oil does not nourish the skin in the way plant oils do Mineral oil does not give the skin any extra goodness it is simply a nonirritating moisturizer working mainly by occlusivity The myths around mineral oil Badmouthing mineral oil is a favorite sport of many it is a cheap material and being connected to petrolatum makes it fairly easy to demonize While it is true that industrial grade mineral oil contains carcinogenic components socalled polycyclic compounds these are completely removed from cosmetic and food grade mineral oil and there is no scientific data showing that the pure cosmetic grade version is carcinogenic\\nWhat is more in terms of the general health effects of mineral oils used in cosmetics a 2017 study reviewed the data on their skin penetration and concluded that the cosmetic use of mineral oils and waxes does not present a risk to consumers due to a lack of systemic exposure Another super common myth surrounding mineral oil is that it is comedogenic A 2005 study titled Is mineral oil comedogenic examined this very question and guess what happened The study concluded that based on the animal and human data reported along with the AAD recommendation it would appear reasonable to conclude that mineral oil is noncomedogenic in humans Overall we feel that the scaremongering around mineral oil is not justified For dry and supersensitive skin types it is a great option However if you do not like its origin or its heavy feeling or anything else about it avoiding it has never been easier Mineral oil has such a bad reputation nowadays that cosmetic companies hardly dare to use it anymore',\n",
       " 'An oily kind of ingredient that can magically blend with water all by itself This is called selfemulsifying and SE in its name stands for that\\nThe difference between normal Glyceryl Stearate and this guy is that the SE grade contains a small amount of waterloving soap molecules such as sodium stearate This increases Glyceryl Stearates affinity for water and gives it stronger emulsifying abilities Other than that it’s a nice emollient that gives a smooth and soft appearance to the skin\\nYou can read some more at Glyceryl Stearate',\n",
