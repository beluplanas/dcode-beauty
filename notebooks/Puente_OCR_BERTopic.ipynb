       " 'Its a helper ingredient that improves the freezethaw stability of products Its also a solvent humectant and to some extent a penetration enhancer It has a bad reputation among natural cosmetics advocates but cosmetic scientists and toxicology experts do not agree read more in the geeky details section Propylene Glycol PG is a colorless liquid whose main job usually is to improve the socalled freezethaw stability of the products This means that it makes sure that a product doesn’t freeze or melt in low or high temperatures To achieve this small amounts usually less than 2 is used Other functions of PG include being a humectant helps skin attract water being a solvent for other ingredients and being a penetration enhancer\\nIf you google PG or you like to read around on sites advocating natural cosmetics you might have read some really scary info about this ingredient The two most common accusations are that it’s a strong skin irritant and that it modifies the skin to allow toxins to penetrate it\\nAs for the first one yes PG can be a skin irritant if used 100 on your skin but so can many things in their pure 100 form Think about salt It’s not the same if you try to eat it in itself or if you put a pinch of it on your food So PG used in small amounts in cosmetics is just fine according to every credible scientist and toxicology expert As for the second thing that PG allows toxins to get through our skin it is somewhat true that PG might help some ingredients to penetrate the skin better But it does not work so that a tiny amount of PG allows all the bad stuff to go right into our blood English cosmetic chemist Colin wrote a very good post about this He writes that the skin is very good at keeping things out and getting some good ingredients into it is actually not easy According to his experience PG is not a very good penetration enhancer and fairly large 1025 amount is needed for this function But more than 10 can be irritating so it’s very rare that a cosmetic product contains this large amount The scientists at the Beauty Brains are even more accepting of PG They write that PG is safe for ingestion it can be a food additive AND safe for use in injected drugs so it’s unlikely to cause any problems in a topical cosmetic product applied on intact skin\\nAll in all PG is a helper ingredient and is not especially good for your skin But used in small 5 amounts it’s absolutely fine not poisonous and there is no reason to be afraid of it If you would like to read some more about PG here is the opinion of skin care expert Paula Begoun cosmetic chemists Colin and the Beauty Brains all really good info on the topic',\n",
